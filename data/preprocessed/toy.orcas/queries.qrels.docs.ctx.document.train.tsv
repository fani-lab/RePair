4454142	skipping heartbeat	Instrumental	['D501063', 'D2212', 'D2146067', 'D1670525']	"Instrumental: http//www.hrsonline.org/patient-resources/symptoms-diagnosis/skipped-beats skipped beats interestingly  both skipped beats and extra beats or palpitations typically have the same cause the hearts regular rhythm is interrupted by a premature or early beat. if the premature beat arises from the atria (upper chambers)  it is called a premature atrial contraction (pac). if it arises from the ventricles (lower chambers)  it is called premature ventricular contraction (pvc). in most cases  neither is considered dangerous  though exceptions exist. the reason pacs or pvcs can sometimes be felt as a skipped beat  is that the heart gets a premature signal to squeeze before it has had time to fill with blood. the resulting heart contraction does not produce blood flow to the body. a pause is felt  and the following heart beat is more forceful than usual. if the pac or pvc is less premature  and the heart has had time to fill with blood before receiving the early signal to squeeze  an extra beat will be felt rather than a skipped beat. premature beats are common in healthy people of all ages. caffeine  alcohol  stress  and fatigue may cause pacs or pvcs to occur more frequently. if the symptoms caused by premature beats are bothersome  they can be treated with medications or catheter ablation . share https//www.mylifestages.org/health/heart/heart_palpitations.page heart palpitations main content heart palpitations what to know about thumps  flutters and skipped beats when it comes to heart palpitations  the increased awareness around heart attack symptoms has been a double-edged sword. on one hand  growing knowledge about heart disease has made us savvier about our bodily symptoms. but at the same time that awareness causes us to worry when we feel a racing heart  rapid pulse or our heart skipping a beat. how serious is it? my life stages talked with san francisco internal medicine doctor toni brayer  m. d.  about the different sensations that bring patients to her office – or the emergency room. she helped us sort them out. ""patients often become aware of their heart beat and wonder if it's normal "" says dr. brayer. ""particularly during menopause  women may feel more random  irregular heartbeats  or the sensation of the heart skipping a beat."" you should never ignore potential heart attack symptoms. the signs of a heart attack in women may be different than in men. but the occasional thump  skipped beat  or a racing heart can make us worry  often unnecessarily. what should we do? heart palpitations are common and often harmless. (see should i be worried about my heart palpitations?) ""the most important thing i tell patients is to sit down  relax   and then take your pulse "" says dr. brayer. ""count the beats of your heart for 15 seconds and multiply by four to get your heart rate. if it's under 100 beats per minute  and you are feeling okay  you are probably not experiencing a serious rhythm disturbance."" exercise  of course  will raise your heart rate above 100  and that's good (as long as you don't exceed your target heart rate). but a resting pulse that suddenly rises to 100 beat per minute or more can be a sign of tachycardia – a more serious disturbance in the rhythm of the heart. if you are feeling irregular beats or a racing heart  and feel light-headed  dizzy or otherwise ""wrong "" then you should call your doctor right away  or head to the emergency room. what causes heart palpitations? irregular beats can have many causes  so if you have the experience on and off  talk with your doctor. medications  fluctuations in hormonal levels  and stress are just a few things that can cause these sensations – without evidence of any underlying heart disease. a few simple tests in the doctor's office can rule out major issues for most. dr. brayer notes that these skipped beats often happen irregularly. you might have a spell at home  but when you arrive at the doctor's office  your heart is beating regularly. one method of diagnosing a recurring sensation is a holter monitor. this device is worn by the patient for 24 hours  and it records the electrical activity of the heart. combined with a journal kept by the patient  the doctor can then discern whether what you are feeling matches a true irregularity in your heart. if you are concerned with your palpitations  don't wait around. see your doctor  who can sort out whether you have an underlying heart condition  or can reassure you of the cause of your flutters – and help you manage the symptoms. the visit will be a wise investment in your peace of mind. next have a question? send a question to our heart health experts or see our library of heart health faqs. http//www.md-health.com/heart-skipping-beats-frequently.html your heart skips a beat  why? your heart skips a beat  why? when your heart skips a beat occasionally  it can be harmless. however  if your heart skips a beat frequently  it may be a sign that there is something wrong. the feeling that your heart is beating irregularly can be concerning. this can feel like a jumpy irregular heartbeat which may make you catch your breath or feel slightly dizzy. in many cases  this is caused by heart palpitations that cause the heart to beat out of sync  causing a fluttering or pounding sensation. however  there are other conditions that may cause this sensation  so it is important to take note if your heart feels as though it is not beating properly for a long period of time or you get this sensation quite often. how to tell if your heart skips a beat when your heart skips a beat  it can feel as though your heart has stuttered for a moment. it can feel as though you cannot catch your breath or you may feel a sudden pounding sensation in the chest or throat. the heart may suddenly have a fluttering or jumping sensation that can feel slightly uncomfortable. you may find yourself suddenly very aware or your heartbeat which can be cause for alarm. heart skipping beats frequently  why? a number of conditions may cause the heart to start beating irregularly. some require more medical conditions than others  so it is important to look at the accompanying symptoms when you are working to diagnose your condition. heart palpitations heart palpitations are one of the most common causes of the fluttering sensation people refer to as the heart skipping a beat. this can feel like you have skipped beats or your heart stopped beating for a few moments. it can also feel as though you are suddenly very aware of your own heartbeat because it is racing or there is a pounding sensation in the neck  throat or chest. this can be caused by diet pills  excessive exercise  fever  high use of illegal drugs  caffeine or nicotine or anxiety and panic attacks. in more severe cases  this could be a sign that you have an abnormal heart valve  overactive thyroid  low oxygen levels or heart disease. patients that suffer from heart skipping beats frequently by heart palpitations are advised to reduce their caffeine or nicotine intake. they are often told that they should not smoke and may need to adjust their diet to include more heart friendly foods. if you are frequently stressed your doctor may recommend that you take steps to help you better manage your anxiety. yoga  meditation or medications may be good ways to keep track of your condition. getting regular exercise can also help balance out your heartbeat to avoid such complications. arrhythmias arrhythmia is a condition that causes the heart to have an abnormal rhythm. this can be caused by a number of conditions that affect the body as a whole. the electrical signals that control the heart may not be working properly  causing the heart to beat irregularly. you may also be receiving different messages that tell your heart to beat faster or slower  causing difficulties in managing your heartbeat at a steady speed. regularly taking drugs that affect the nervous system  beta-blockers  consuming alcohol  caffeine or stimulants or taking medications used to treat psychosis or depression can also contribute to this condition. if you are dealing with heart arrhythmia  you may notice chest pain that is accompanied by light-headedness or shortness of breath. you may begin sweating  turn pale or feel dizzy. in some cases you may faint. in order to manage heart arrhythmia  you may need to undergo shock therapy to attempt to force the heart back onto a normal rhythm. you can also take medications that help to steady the heart rate  not allowing it to get too low or high. in some cases where the heart is not beating correctly the patient will have a pacemaker  implantable cardiac defibrillator or cardiac ablation installed to help manage their heartbeat. tachycardia tachycardia is caused when the heart is beating faster than it should. this is often accompanied by a rapid pulse rate  heart palpitations (with symptoms like heart skipping beats frequently)  chest pain  shortness of breath  lightheadedness  chest pain and fainting. in some cases patients will have no symptoms  but the condition will be noted during a physical examination. tachycardia is caused by something disrupting the normal electrical impulses that control the heart. this can be caused by high blood pressure  excessive intake of caffeine or recreational drugs  smoking  damage to the heart  imbalance of electrolytes  overactive thyroid and others. medications may be prescribed to help manage this condition  helping to block the channels that can raise the heart rate. you may also need to have surgery to correct the electrical pathways controlling your heart or to have an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or pacemaker installed. premature heart beats premature heart beats are caused when the electrical sensors of the heart overact and cause the heart to beat earlier than expected. this is a type of arrhythmia that can cause the heat to fill with blood while it is sitting still  then force it out with an excessively large heartbeat. premature heartbeats are frequently caused by lack of sleep  excessive amounts of exercise  high intake of nicotine or caffeine or high levels of stress. premature ventricular complex (pvcs). premature ventricular complex causes excess heartbeats when the lower part of your heart gets out of sync with the upper part of the heart. this can cause an uncomfortable flip flopping sensation that may cause you to catch your breath momentarily. in most cases eliminating alcohol or tobacco use  or taking beta blockers can help eliminate this condition. premature atrial contractions (pacs). this is one of the most common forms of arrhythmia. this is caused when the body fails to send an electrical impulse to the heart  causing it to sit still rather than beating when it should. so you may feel heart skipping beats frequently. these are frequently caused by an excess intake of caffeine or hypertension throughout the body. taking beta or calcium blockers can often eliminate this condition. https//www.health.harvard.edu/heart-disease-overview/skipping-a-beat--the-surprise-of-palpitations skipping a beat â the surprise of heart palpitations skipping a beat — the surprise of heart palpitations updated october 31  2017 published september  2005does your heart unexpectedly start to race or pound  or feel like it keeps skipping beats? these sensations are called palpitations. for most people  heart palpitations are a once-in-a-blue-moon occurrence. others have dozens a day  sometimes so strong that they feel like a heart attack. most palpitations are caused by a harmless hiccup in the hearts rhythm. a few reflect a problem in the heart or elsewhere in the body. doctors can be quick to attribute palpitations to anxiety  depression  or some other emotional or psychological problem. although sometimes thats right  its important to first rule out harmful heart rhythms and other physical causes. symptoms of palpitations different people experience heart palpitations in different ways. palpitations can feel like the heart is fluttering  throbbing  flip-flopping  murmuring  or pounding. they can also feel like the heart skips a beat. some people feel palpitations as a pounding in the chest or neck; others feel them as a general sense of unease. common triggers of heart palpitations palpitations can appear out of the blue and disappear just as suddenly. they can be linked with certain activities  events  or emotions. exercise and physical activity can generate palpitations  as can anxiety or stress. some people notice their heart skipping a beat when they are drifting off to sleep; others  when they stand up after bending over. common triggers of palpitations includestress  anxiety  or panicdehydrationlow potassiumlow blood sugartoo much caffeine  chocolate  or alcoholnicotineexercisestanding upswallowingfeverprior heart attackmitral valve prolapseanemiaoveractive thyroidpregnancymenopauseheartburn (acid reflux)drugs and medications such as cocaine  amphetamines  diet pills  some cough and cold remedies  some antibiotics  thyroid hormone  digoxin  or asthma remediesdietary supplements such as ephedra  ginseng  bitter orange  valerian  or hawthorn. why does my heart skip a beat? there are several possible causes of heart palpitations. trouble from above. some palpitations stem from premature contractions of the hearts upper chambers (atria). when the atria contract a fraction of a second earlier than they should  they rest an instant longer afterward to get back to their usual rhythm. this feels like a skipped beat and is often followed by a noticeably forceful contraction as the lower chambers (ventricles) clear out the extra blood they accumulated during the pause. these premature beats are almost always benign  meaning they arent life-threatening or the sign of a heart attack in the making. two other heart rhythm disturbances that can cause palpitations from above are atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia. atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heartbeat caused by chaotic electrical activity in the hearts upper chambers. supraventricular tachycardia is a faster-than-normal heart rate ( tachycardia means fast heart rate) that begins above the hearts lower chambers. both of these may cause palpitations that may be brief or prolonged. both should be evaluated by your physician. trouble from below. early contractions of the ventricles can also cause palpitations. a solo premature ventricular contraction  or even a couple in a row  isnt usually a problem unless its accompanied by fainting  shortness of breath  or other symptoms. a long run of premature ventricular contractions one after the other  though  is worrisome. they can degenerate into the deadly cardiac chaos known as ventricular fibrillation. other sources. problems with the hearts timekeeper  called the pacemaker or sinus node  can cause palpitations. so can a breakdown in the coordination between the upper and lower chambers. scar tissue in the heart from a heart attack or other injury and valve problems such as mitral valve prolapse can also lead to palpitations. diagnosing heart palpitations palpitations tend to come and go. unfortunately  they are usually gone by the time you get to the doctors office. that makes pinning them down a joint effort. one of the most helpful pieces of information is your story of how your heart palpitations feel  how often they strike  and when. try to answer some of these questions before seeing your doctor when you have heart palpitations  check your pulse. is your hearts rhythm fast or slow? regular or irregular? when your heart skips a beat  do you feel lightheaded  dizzy  or out of breath  or do you have chest pain? are you often doing the same thing when they occur? do your heart palpitations start and stop suddenly  or fade in and out? a physical exam can reveal telltale signs of palpitations. your doctor may hear a murmur or other sound when listening to your heart that suggests a problem with one of the hearts valves. he or she may also discover a thyroid imbalance  anemia  low potassium  or other problems that can cause or contribute to palpitations. an electrocardiogram ( ecg) is a standard tool for evaluating someone with palpitations. this recording of your hearts electrical activity shows the hearts rhythm and any overt or subtle disturbances  but only over the course of 12 seconds or so. your doctor may want to record your heart rhythm for longer to identify the cause of the palpitations. if your palpitations come with chest pain  your doctor may want you to have an exercise stress test. if they come with a racing pulse or dizziness  an electrophysiology study using a special probe inserted into the heart may be in order. capturing heart palpitations in action if you are at risk for a heart rhythm problem  or if palpitations are interfering with your life or mental health  a recording of your hearts rhythm for 24 hours or even longer may capture an electrical signature of the problem. getting visual evidence of this signature can help determine how best to treat your palpitations. a holter monitor constantly records your hearts rhythm for 24 hours as you go about your daily activities. small patches called electrodes are stuck onto your chest and attached to a recorder that you carry in a pocket or wear around your neck or waist. during the test  you keep a diary of what you are doing and how you feel  along with the time of day of each entry. when you return the monitor to your doctor  he or she will look at the recording to see if there have been any irregular heart rhythms. twenty-four hours often isnt long enough to detect palpitations. an event recorder can monitor the heart for days or weeks. theres even an implantable recorder that can invisibly monitor the heart for a year or more. treating heart palpitations self-help techniques if you have unexplained palpitations  start with the simple things first try cutting back on caffeine — or giving it up altogether — to see if it is contributing to the problem. dont smoke. cut back on alcohol  or stop drinking it altogether. make sure you eat regularly (low blood sugar can cause heart palpitations). drink plenty of fluids. get enough sleep. have your doctor or pharmacist check all of your medications and supplements to make sure none cause palpitations. over-the-counter products often responsible for palpitations are decongestants that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine. stress and anxiety are two other key triggers of skipped beats. a two-step approach can help here. to keep palpitations away  try meditation  the relaxation response  exercise  yoga  tai chi  or another stress-busting activity. if palpitations do appear  breathing exercises or tensing and relaxing individual muscle groups in your body can help. deep breathing. sit quietly and close your eyes. place one hand on your abdomen. breathe in slowly and deeply through your nose. feel your abdomen move outward. exhale through your nose or mouth  whichever feels more comfortable. repeat. if your heart is racing unexpectedly  you can try to stop it yourself with one of the following maneuvers. however  if they dont work promptly and the symptoms persist  have someone drive you to the emergency department or call 911. valsalva maneuver. pinch your nose closed with the fingers of one hand. close your mouth. try to breathe out forcibly through your nose. bear down. clench your stomach muscles

static int b = 2; int main () {} void f () { static int c = 3; int d = 4; }all the static variables persist until program terminates. the variable d has local scope and no linkage - its no use outside of f (). but c remains in memory even when the f () function is not being executed. by saying that c is static  we are saying that we want to allocate it once  and only once  at some point before the first time that f () is called  and that we do not want to deallocate it as long as our program runs. both a and b can be accessed from the point of declaration until the end of the file. but a can be used in other files because it has external linkage. all static duration variables have the following initialization characteristics an uninitialized static variable set to 0. a static variable can be initialized only with a constant expression.int x; // x set to 0 int y = 50; // 50 is literal constant int z = sizeof (int); // sizeof ok int zz = 10 * x; // not allowed  x is not constant int main () {...}const and extern the const in c++ has gives a little bit of twist to the default storage classes. while a global variable has external linkage by default  a const global has internal linkage by default. in other words  c++ treats a global const definition as if the static had been used as in the following code.const int a = 10; int main () { .... so  the const int a = 10 becomes static const int a = 10. however  if global const had external linkage as regular variables do  the const declaration would be an error because we can define a global variable in one file only. in other words  only one file can contain the preceding declaration  and the other files have to provide reference declarations using the extern keyword. note that only the declarations without the extern can initialize values. however  if we want to make a constant have external linkage  we can use the extern keyword to override the default internal linkageextern const int a = 20;here  we should use the extern keyword to declare the constant in all files that use the constant. thats the difference between regular external variables and constant. for regular external variables  we dont use the keyword extern when we define a variable  but we use extern in other files using that variable.extern an extern declaration does not define the variable unless it is also initialized in the same statement.extern int x; // declaration extern int x = 10; // definition for extern c  please visit extern c. static storage and dynamic allocation dynamic memory is controlled by the new and delete operators  not by scope and linkage rules. so  dynamic memory can be allocated from one function and freed from another function. although the storage schemes dont apply to dynamic memory  then do apply to automatic and static pointer variables used to keep track of dynamic memory. lets look at the following line of codeint *ptr = new int [10];the 40 bytes of memory allocated by new remains in memory until the delete frees it. but the pointer ptr passes from existence when the function containing this declaration terminates. if we want to have the 40 bytes of allocated memory available from another function  we need to pass or return its address to that function. on the other hand  if we declare ptr with external linkage  the ptr pointer will be available by usingextern int *ptr;however  a statement that uses new to set ptr has to be in a function because static storage variables can only be initialized with constant expressions as shown in the following example.int *ptr; // initialization with non-const not allowed here // int *ptr = new int [10]; int main () { ptr = new int [10]; ... see memory allocation. static class member static members exist as members of the class rather than as an instance in each object of the class. so  this keyword is not available in a static member function. such functions may access only static data members. there is a single instance of each static data member for the entire class  which should be initialized  usually in the source file that implements the class member functions. because the member is initialized outside the class definition  we must use fully qualified name when we initialize itclass_namestatic_member_name = value;here is the real life example  car.hclass car { private static int id; public car (); ... };implementation file  car.cpp#include <iostream> int carid = 100; ... car car () {} .... the code initializes the static id member to 100. note again that we cannot initialize a static member variable inside the class declaration. thats because the declaration is a description of how memory is to be allocated  but it doesnt allocate memory. we allocate and initialize memory by creating an object using that format. in the case of a static class member  we initialize the static member independently  with a separate statement outside the class declaration. thats because the static class member is stored separately rather than as part of an object. the exception to the initialization of a static data member inside the class declaration is if the static data member is a const of integral or enumeration type.#include <iostream> class car { enum color {silver = 0  maroon  red }; int year; int mileage = 34289; // error not-static data members // only static const integral data members // can be initialized within a class static int vin = 12345678; // error non-constant data member // only static const integral data members // can be initialized within a class static const string model = sonata; // error not-integral type // cannot have in-class initializer static const int engine = 6; // allowed static const integral type }; int caryear = 2013; // error non-static data members // cannot be defined out-of-class int main () { return 0; }the following example shows an illegal access to non-static member from a static function.class x { public int x; static void f (int); }; void xf (int z) {x=z;}in function f ()  x=z is an error because f ()  a static function  is trying to access non-static member x. so  the fix should be like thisclass x { public static int x; static void f (int); }; void xf (int z) {x=z;}non-static members can not be used as default arguments the following code shows that a non-static members can not be used as default arguments.#include <iostream> int x global = 7; struct foo { int x member; static int x static; foo (int x)  x member (x) {} int a (int x = x global) { return x; } int b ( int x = x member) // wrong wont compile { return x; } int c (int x = x static) { return x; } }; int foox static = 1; int main () { foo f (911); stdcout << f.a () << stdendl; stdcout << f.b () << stdendl; stdcout << f.c () << stdendl; return 0; }static member functions here are some characteristics of static member functions a static member function can only access static member data  static member functions and data and functions outside the class. so  we must take note not to use static member function in the same manner as non-static member function  as non-static member function can access all of the above including the static data member. we must first understand the concept of static data while learning the context of static functions. it is possible to declare a data member of a class as static irrespective of it being a public or a private type in class definition. if a data is declared as static  then the static data is created and initialized only once. non-static data members are created again and again. for each separate object of the class  the static data is created and initialized only once. as in the concept of static data  all objects of the class in static functions share the variables. this applies to all objects of the class. a non-static member function can be called only after instantiating the class as an object. this is not the case with static member functions. a static member function can be called  even when a class is not instantiated. a static member function cannot have access to the this pointer of the class. a non-static member function can be declared as virtual but care must be taken not to declare a static member function as virtual. static - singleton pattern singleton design pattern is a good example of static member function and static member variable. in this pattern  we put constructor in private section not in public section of a class. so  we can not access the constructor to make an instance of the class. instead  we put a public function which is static function. the get instance () will make an instance only once. note that if this method is not static  there is no way to invoke the get instance () even though it is public method. thats because we do not have any instance of singleton.#include <iostream> using namespace std; class singleton { public static singleton *get instance (); private singleton () {}static singleton *instance; }; singleton* singletoninstance = 0; singleton* singletonget instance () { if (!instance) { instance = new singleton (); cout << get instance () first instance\n; return instance; } else { cout << get instance () previous instance\n; return instance; } } int main () { singleton* s1 = singletonget instance (); singleton* s2 = singletonget instance (); return 0; }output isget instance () first instance get instance () previous instance external linkage and static keyword external linkage means that a symbol in one translation unit can be accesses from the other translation units. unless we take special steps  the functions and global variables in our .cpp will have external linkage.const int my_constant = 199; // (note)in c++  this has internal linkage  it is same as static const stdstring my_name = bo go; void my_function () {}here is the code that can access the my_constant  my_name  and my_function () without using public interfaces  thus breaking encapsulationextern const int my_constant; extern stdstring my_name; extern void my_function (); .... one way of avoid this linkage issue is using static keywordstatic const int my_constant = 199; static stdstring my_name = bo go; static void my_function () {}though we can avoid the external linkage problem by using static keyword  it still has issue of polluting global namespace. so  the batter solution is to use anonymous namespace as shown belownamespace { const int my_constant = 199; stdstring my_name = bo go; void my_function () {} }  https//www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_static_members.htm static members of a c++ class static members of a c++ class advertisements previous page next page we can define class members static using static keyword. when we declare a member of a class as static it means no matter how many objects of the class are created  there is only one copy of the static member. a static member is shared by all objects of the class. all static data is initialized to zero when the first object is created  if no other initialization is present. we cant put it in the class definition but it can be initialized outside the class as done in the following example by redeclaring the static variable  using the scope resolution operator  to identify which class it belongs to. let us try the following example to understand the concept of static data members −live demo#include <iostream>using namespace std;class box {publicstatic int object count;// constructor definition box ( double l = 2.0  double b = 2.0  double h = 2.0) {cout << constructor called. << endl;length = l;breadth = b;height = h;// increase every time object is createdobject count ++;}double volume () {return length * breadth * height;}privatedouble length;

i < 10; ++ i)foo ();}this printsa = 15  sa = 15a = 15  sa = 20a = 15  sa = 25a = 15  sa = 30a = 15  sa = 35a = 15  sa = 40a = 15  sa = 45a = 15  sa = 50a = 15  sa = 55a = 15  sa = 60this is useful for cases where a function needs to keep some state between invocations  and you dont want to use global variables. beware  however  this feature should be used very sparingly - it makes your code not thread-safe and harder to understand. (2) is used widely as an access control feature. if you have a .c file implementing some functionality  it usually exposes only a few public functions to users. the rest of its functions should be made static  so that the user wont be able to access them. this is encapsulation  a good practice. quoting wikipedia in the c programming language  static is used with global variables and functions to set their scope to the containing file. in local variables  static is used to store the variable in the statically allocated memory instead of the automatically allocated memory. while the language does not dictate the implementation of either type of memory  statically allocated memory is typically reserved in data segment of the program at compile time  while the automatically allocated memory is normally implemented as a transient call stack. see here and here for more details. and to answer your second question  its not like in c#. in c++  however  static is also used to define class attributes (shared between all objects of the same class) and methods. in c there are no classes  so this feature is irrelevant.share improve this answeredited aug 12 14 at 1425user10431483 1 1

file the compiler sees. your .c file may include other .c files  but after the preprocessor sorting out the includes  the compiler eventually sees just a single compilation unit. – eli bendersky feb 21 09 at 71260@rob uk the compiler doesnt even know about the .h files - these are combined into the .c files in the pre-processor. so yes you can say that the .c file  with all the headers included into it  are a single compilation unit. – eli bendersky feb 16 10 at 444show 21 more commentsup vote180down vote there is one more use not covered here  and that is as part of an array type

through to arg [9] to have values (which also implies that the function does not accept a null pointer). compilers could utilise this information somehow for optimisation  and static analysers can utilise this information to ensure that the function is never given a null pointer (or if it can tell  an array with fewer elements than specified). – dreamlax sep 29 15 at 211614@qix -- this was a

words they are global variables  but scoped to the local function they are defined in. static global variables are not visible outside of the c file they are defined in. static functions are not

variables static if you can. in c programming  files are often used to represent classes  and static variables represent private static members of the class. what standards say about it c99 n1256 draft 6.7.1 storage-class specifiers says that static is a storage-class specifier.6.2.2/3 linkages of identifiers says static implies internal linkage if the declaration of a file scope identifier for an object or a function contains the storage-class specifier static  the identifier has internal linkage.and 6.2.2/2 says that internal linkage behaves like in our example in the set of translation units and libraries that constitutes an entire program  each declaration of a particular identifier with external linkage denotes the same object or function. within one translation unit  each declaration of an identifier with internal linkage denotes the same object or function.where translation unit is a source file after preprocessing. how gcc implements it for elf (linux)? with the stb_local binding. if we compileint i = 0;static int si = 0;and disassemble the symbol table withreadelf - s main. othe output contains num value size type bind vis ndx name5 0000000000000004 4 object local default 4 si 10 0000000000000000 4 object global default 4 iso the binding is the only significant difference between them. value is just their offset into the .bss section  so we expect it to differ. stb_local is documented on the elf spec at http//www.sco.com/developers/gabi/2003-12-17/ch4.symtab.html stb_local local symbols are not visible outside the object file containing their definition. local symbols of the same name may exist in multiple files without interfering with each otherwhich makes it a perfect choice to represent static. variables without static are stb_global  and the spec says when the link editor combines several relocatable object files  it does not allow multiple definitions of stb_global symbols with the same name.which is coherent with the link errors on multiple non static definitions. if we crank up the optimization with -o3  the si symbol is removed entirely from the symbol table it cannot be used from outside anyways. todo why keep static variables on the symbol table at all when there is no optimization? can they be used for anything? maybe for debugging. see alsoanalogous for static functions

two meanings. i offer an alternate way of viewing it that gives it a single meaning applying static to an item forces that item to have two properties (a) it is not visible outside the current scope; (b) it is persistent. the reason it seems to have two meanings is that  in c  every item to which static may be applied already has one of these two properties  so it seems as if that particular usage only involves the other. for example  consider variables. variables declared outside of functions already have persistence (in the data segment)  so applying static can only make them not visible outside the current scope (compilation unit). contrariwise  variables declared inside of functions already have non-visibility outside the current scope (function)  so applying static can only make them persistent. applying static to functions is just like applying it to global variables - code is necessarily persistent (at least within the language)  so only visibility can be altered. note these comments only apply to c. in c++  applying static to class methods is truly giving the keyword a different meaning. similarly for the c99 array-argument extension.share improve this

programming language. in short  the word static is used with two meanings static is one of the two storage classes (the other being automatic). a static object keeps its value between invocations. the objects declared outside all blocks are always static and cannot be made automatic. but  when the static keyword (big emphasis on it being used in code as a keyword) is used with a declaration  it gives that object internal linkage so it can only be used within that translation unit. but if the keyword is used in a function  it changes the storage class of the object (the object would only be visible within that function anyway). the opposite of static is the extern keyword  which gives an object external linkage. peter van der linden gives these two meanings in expert c programming inside a function  retains its value between calls. at the function level  visible only in this file.share improve this answeredited apr 12 16 at 334answered mar 30 16 at 2349nobism371 4 16add a commentup

1;var ++;printf ( %d  var );}int main () {function (); // call 1function (); // call 2}in the above program  var is stored in the data segment. its lifetime is the whole c program. after function call 1  var becomes 2. after function call 2  var becomes 3. the value of var is not destroyed between functions calls. if var had between non static and local variable  it would be stored in the stack segment in the c program. since the stack frame of the function is destroyed after the function returns  the value of var is also destroyed. initialized static variables are stored in the data segment of the c program whereas uninitialized ones are stored in the bss segment. another information about static if a variable is global and static  it has the life time of the c program  but it has file

members static data members are not associated with any object. they exist even if no objects of the class have been defined. if the static member is declared thread_local (since c++11)  there is one such object per thread. otherwise  there is only one instance of the static data member in the entire program  with static storage duration . static data members cannot be mutable . static data members of a class in namespace scope have external linkage if the class itself has external linkage (i.e. is not a member of unnamed namespace ). local classes (classes defined inside functions) and unnamed classes  including member classes of unnamed classes  cannot have static data members. a static data member may be declared inline. an inline static data member can be defined in the class

[9] although released when 16-bit version 1.5 was available  it did not include support for ole2 and odbc. it was also available in a bundle called visual c++ 16/32-bit suite  which included visual c++ 1.5. [10]visual c++ 2.0  which included mfc 3.0  was the first version to be 32-bit only. in many ways  this version was ahead of its time  since windows 95  then codenamed chicago  was not yet released  and windows nt had only a small market share. as a result  this release was almost a lost generation. microsoft included and updated visual c++ 1.5 as part of the 2.x releases up to 2.1  which included visual c++ 1.52  and both 16-bit and 32-bit version of the control development kit (cdk) were included. visual c++ 2.x also supported win32s development. it is available through microsoft developer network. there was a visual c++ 2.0 risc edition for mips and alpha processors  as well as a cross-platform edition for the macintosh ( 68000 instruction set). [11]visual c++ 2.1 and 2.2 were updates for 2.0 available through subscription. visual c++ 4.0  released on 1995-12-11  [12] introduced the developer studio ide. its then-novel tiled layout of non-overlapping panels—navigation panel  combination editor/source level debugger panel  and console output panel [13] —continues through the visual studio product line (as of 2013). visual c++ 4.0 included mfc 4.0  was designed for windows 95 and windows nt. to allow support of legacy (windows 3.x/dos) projects  4.0 came bundled with the visual c++ 1.52 installation cd. updates available through subscription included visual c++ 4.1  which came with the microsoft game sdk (later released separately as the direct x sdk)  and visual c++ 4.2. version number 3.0 was skipped to achieve version number parity between visual c++ 4.0 and mfc 4.0. [14]visual c++ 4.2 did not support windows 3.x ( win32s) development. [15] this was the final version with a cross-platform edition for the macintosh available and it differed from the 2.x version in that it also allowed compilation for the power pc instruction set. visual c++ 5.0  which included mfc 4.21 and was released 1997-04-28  [12] was a major upgrade from 4.2. [16] available in four editions learning  [17] professional  [18] enterprise  [19] and risc. [20]visual c++ 6.0 (commonly known as vc6)  which included mfc 6.0  was released in 1998. [21] the release was somewhat controversial since it did not include an expected update to mfc. visual c++ 6.0 is still quite popular and often used to maintain legacy projects. there are  however  issues with this version under windows xp  especially under the debugging mode (for example  the values of static variables do not display). the debugging issues can be solved with a patch called the visual c++ 6.0 processor pack. [22] version number 12.00.8804visual c++ . net 2002 (also known as visual c++ 7.0)  which included mfc 7.0  was released in 2002 with support for link time code generation and debugging runtime checks  . net 1.0  and visual c# and managed c++. the new user interface used many of the hot keys and conventions of visual basic  which accounted for some of its unpopularity among c++ developers. [ citation needed] version number 13.00.9466visual c++ . net 2003 (also known as visual c++ 7.1)  which included mfc 7.1  was released in 2003 along with . net 1.1 and was a major upgrade to visual c++ . net 2002. it was considered a patch to visual c++ . net 2002. accordingly  the english language upgrade version of visual studio . net 2003 shipped for minimal cost to owners of the english-language version of visual studio . net 2002. this was the last version to support windows 95 and nt 4.0 as a target. [ citation needed] version number 13.10.3077e mbedded visual c++ [23] in various versions was used to develop for some versions of the windows ce operating system. initially it replaced a development environment consisting of tools added onto visual c++ 6.0. e mbedded visual c++ was replaced as a separate development environment by microsoft visual studio 2005.32-bit and 64-bit versions [ edit]visual c++ 2005 (also known as visual c++ 8.0)  which included mfc 8.0  was released in november 2005. this version supports . net 2.0 and includes a new version of c++ targeted to the . net framework ( c++/cli) with the purpose of replacing the previous version ( managed c++ ). managed c++ for cli is still available via compiler options  though. it also introduced open mp. with visual c++ 2005  microsoft also introduced team foundation server. visual c++ 8.0 has problems compiling mfc app wizard projects that were created using visual studio 6.0  so maintenance of legacy projects can be continued with the original ide if rewriting is not feasible. visual c++ 2005 is the last version able to target windows 98 and windows me. [24] [25] sp1 version (14.00.50727.762) is also available in microsoft windows sdk update for windows vista. visual c++ 2008 (also known as visual c++ 9.0) was released in november 2007. this version supports . net 3.5. managed c++ for cli is still available via compiler options. by default  all applications compiled against the visual c++ 2008 runtimes (static and dynamic linking) will only work under windows 2000 and later. [26] [27] a feature pack released for vc9  later included in sp1  added support for c++ tr1 library extensions. sp1 version (15.00.30729.01) is also available in microsoft windows sdk for windows 7. some versions of visual c++ supported itanium 2visual c++ 2010 (also known as visual c++ 10.0) was released on april 12  2010. it uses a sql server compact database to store information about the source code  including intelli sense information  for better intelli sense and code-completion support. [28] however  visual c++ 2010 does not support intellisense for c++/cli. [29] this version adds a c++ parallel computing library called the parallel patterns library  partial support for c++11  significantly improved intelli sense based on the edison design group front end  [30] and performance improvements to both the compiler and generated code. [31] this version is built on . net 4.0  but supports compiling to machine code. the partial c++11 support mainly consists of six compiler features [32] lambdas  rvalue references  auto  decltype  static_assert  and nullptr. c++11 also supports library features (e.g.  moving the tr1 components from stdtr1 namespace directly to std namespace). variadic templates were also considered  but delayed until some future version due to having a lower priority  which stemmed from the fact that  unlike other costly-to-implement features (lambda  rvalue references)  variadic templates would benefit only a minority of library writers rather than the majority of compiler end users. [33] by default  all applications compiled against visual c++ 2010 runtimes only work on windows xp sp2 and later. the rtm version (16.00.30319) is also available in windows sdk for windows 7 and . net framework 4 (win sdk v7.1). [34] sp1 version (16.00.40219) is available as part of visual studio 2010 service pack 1 or through the microsoft visual c++ 2010 service pack 1 compiler update for the windows sdk 7.1. [35]visual c++ 2012 (also known as visual c++ 11.0) was released on august 15  2012. it features improved c++11 support  and support for windows runtime development. [36]visual c++ 2013 (also known as visual c++ 12.0) was released on october 17  2013. it features further c++11 and c99 support  and introduces a rest sdk. [37]visual c++ 2015 (also known as visual c++ 14.0) was released on july 20  2015. [38] it features improved c++11/14/17 support. [39] without any announcement from microsoft  visual studio 2015 update 2 started generating telemetry calls in compiled binaries. after some users contacted microsoft about this problem  microsoft said they would remove these telemetry calls when compiling with the future visual studio 2015 update 3. [40] [41] the function in question was removed from the visual c++ crt static libraries in visual studio 2015 update 3. [ citation needed]visual c++ 2017 (also known as visual c++ 14.1) was released on march 7  2017. internal version numbering [ edit]the predefined macro _msc_ver indicates the major and minor version numbers of the visual c++ compiler. the macros value is an integer literal in which the last two digits indicate the minor version number and the preceding digits indicate the major version number. from visual studio 2017  _msc_ver is incremented monotonically at every visual c++ toolset update. thus  for example  the version of msvc++ 14.1 that ships with visual studio 2017 version 15.3.0 sets _msc_ver to 1911. microsoft recommends using the >= operator to test the value of _msc_ver. here are values of _msc_ver for various versions of the visual c++ compiler msc 1.0 _msc_ver == 100msc 2.0 _msc_ver == 200msc 3.0 _msc_ver == 300msc 4.0 _msc_ver == 400msc 5.0 _msc_ver == 500msc 6.0 _msc_ver == 600msc 7.0 _msc_ver == 700msvc ++ 1.0 _msc_ver == 800msvc ++ 2.0 _msc_ver == 900msvc ++ 4.0 _msc_ver == 1000 ( developer studio 4.0)msvc ++ 4.2 _msc_ver == 1020 ( developer studio 4.2)msvc ++ 5.0 _msc_ver == 1100 ( visual studio 97 version 5.0)msvc ++ 6.0 _msc_ver == 1200 ( visual studio 6.0 version 6.0)msvc ++ 7.0 _msc_ver == 1300 ( visual studio. net 2002 version 7.0)msvc ++ 7.1 _msc_ver == 1310 ( visual studio. net 2003 version 7.1)msvc ++ 8.0 _msc_ver == 1400 ( visual studio 2005 version 8.0)msvc ++ 9.0 _msc_ver == 1500 ( visual studio 2008 version 9.0)msvc ++ 10.0 _msc_ver == 1600 ( visual studio 2010 version 10.0)msvc ++ 11.0 _msc_ver == 1700 ( visual studio 2012 version 11.0)msvc ++ 12.0 _msc_ver == 1800 ( visual studio 2013 version 12.0)msvc ++ 14.0 _msc_ver == 1900 ( visual studio 2015 version 14.0)msvc ++ 14.1 _msc_ver == 1910 ( visual studio 2017 version 15.0)msvc ++ 14.11 _msc_ver == 1911 ( visual studio 2017 version 15.3)msvc ++ 14.12 _msc_ver == 1912 ( visual studio 2017 version 15.5)msvc ++ 14.13 _msc_ver == 1913 ( visual studio 2017 version 15.6)msvc ++ 14.14 _msc_ver == 1914 ( visual studio 2017 version 15.7)these version numbers refer to the major version number of the visual c++ compilers and libraries  as can be seen from the installation directories. it does not refer to the year in the name of the visual studio release. a thorough list is available. [42]compatibility [ edit]abi [ edit]the visual c++ compiler abi have historically changed between major compiler releases. [43] this is especially the case for stl containers  where container sizes have varied a lot between compiler releases. [44] microsoft therefore recommends against using c++ interfaces at module boundaries when one wants to enable client code compiled using a different compiler version. instead of c++  microsoft recommends using c [45] or com [46] interfaces  which are designed to have a stable abi between compiler releases. c runtime libraries [ edit]visual c++ ships with different versions of c runtime libraries. [47] this means users can compile their code with any of the available libraries. however  this can cause some problems when using different components ( dlls  exes) in the same program. a typical example is a program using different libraries. the user should use the same c run-time for all the programs components unless the implications are understood. microsoft recommends using the multithreaded  dynamic link library (/md or /mdd compiler option) to avoid possible problems. [47]c99 [ edit]although the product originated as an ide for the c programming language  for many years the compilers support for that language conformed only to the original edition of the c standard  dating from 1989. the later revisions of the standard  c99 and c11  were not supported at all [48] until visual c++ 2013  which added support for various c99 features in its c mode (including designated initializers  compound literals  and the _bool type) [49]  though it is still not complete. [50] visual c++ 2015 further improves the c99 support  with full support of the c99 standard library  except for features that require c99 language features not yet supported by the compiler.

why are there so many ""microsoft visual c++ redistributables"" installed on my pc?by walter glenn on may 24th  2016if you've ever scrolled through your list of installed programs in windows  wondering why there are so many versions of the microsoft visual c++ redistributable on there  you're not alone. join us as we take a look at what these things are and why there are so many installed on your pc. what is a visual c++ redistributable? microsoft visual c++ is a integrated development environment (ide) used to create windows applications in the c  c++  and c++/cli programming languages. it was originally a standalone product  but is now included as part of microsoft visual studio. it offers developers a single application in which they can write  edit  test  and debug their code. the programming environment includes access to a lot of shared code libraries  which let developers use already-developed code for specific procedures instead of having to write their own from scratch. that shared code takes the form of dynamic link libraries (dlls)  a term most windows users have come across at some point or other. when it comes time to deploy their software to users  developers have a choice to make. they can bundle those dlls into the installation of their application  or they can rely on a standard distributable package of shared code. most choose the latter  and that package is known as a visual c++ redistributable. there are several advantages to using a redistributable. the packages are made available by microsoft  who also tests and updates them with bug and security fixes. redistributables also offer a single installation on a user's computer that multiple programs can use at the same time. why are so many installed on my pc? i installed a fresh version of windows 10 on a new pc a little less than two months ago. as you can see in the picture above  i've already got four versions of the visual c++ redistributable on my system. on other systems  i've seen as many as twenty. so  how do they all they get there? some are installed along with windows itself. the specific versions that get installed depend on which version of windows you're using. i'm using windows 10  which comes with the 2012 and 2013 visual c++ redistributables. you'll also note that i've also got both the 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions installed. if you have a 32-bit version of windows  you won't see those 64-bit versions of the redistributable. but if you have a 64-bit version of windows (which almost all computers are these days)  you'll see both versions  because a 64-bit windows can run both 64-bit and 32-bit applications. any additional versions of the visual c++ redistributable you see on your system were installed along with some program that required it. when a developer codes in a specific version of visual c++  the code libraries for that version must also be present on the user's system for the application to run. that means that  for example  if a developer used visual c++ 2005 (or visual studio 2005) to create a program you're installing  you can expect to see the visual c++ 2005 redistributable installed on your system along with the program. sometimes  you'll get a pop up the first time you run a program saying that the redistributable package is being installed. you'll notice this a lot if you're a pc gamer  especially if you get your games through steam. typically  this means that the developer has chosen to have the latest package downloaded from microsoft at installation time. sometimes  the package is bundled along with the application. here's a shot of the installation of the current amd graphics driver package  which you can see wants to install the 2012 and 2013 c++ redistributables. related what is the microsoft . net framework  and why is it installed on my pc? it's also possible that you'll see what look like multiple versions of the same redistributable installed  or at least multiple versions from the same year. for example  you might see multiple versions of the 2008 redistributable. one might indicate that it's a service pack  while others might just have slightly different version numbers. so  while it sometimes looks like multiple versions of the same package are installed  they are all subtly different. and unfortunately  unlike with the somewhat similar . net framework  microsoft never consolidated all these older versions into a unified package. so in short you'll see some packages that come with windows  and some that come with applications you install. and if you're running 64-bit windows  you'll see both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of each package. can i uninstall some of them? the short answer is yes  but you probably shouldn't. you never really know which of your installed applications rely on each redistributable. if you uninstall a program  that program will not automatically remove the redistributable upon which it relied  since it has no way of knowing if other applications also rely upon it. sure  there may be some redistributable packages on there that you don't need–but if you manually remove a redistributable package that some programs are still using  you could cause them to not run correctly and  in some cases  even cause problems in your windows installation itself. it may irritate you seeing so many sitting there in your list of installed programs  but if things are running well on your pc  the redistributables aren't causing any harm. they also don't take up much space. the four versions i have installed on my system right now take up less than 100 mb of disk space  combined. we have seen some advice floating around the internet suggesting that you can remove older versions of redistributables  leaving just the most recent from each major release (noted by year) in place. in other words  they suggest you could leave the latest 2012 redistributable in place and uninstall older 2012 versions. we've tested this and found it to be unreliable. it seems to work sometimes  but there's no guarantee it will work for you. in my own limited test of three systems  it caused problems on one system where a couple of programs would no longer run. what can i do if i'm having problems? unfortunately  it's often hard to narrow a problem with an application down to a bad redistributable installation. you rarely get an error message during installation or operation of a program that points you directly to the redistributable packages. still  it is a possibility and sometimes it's worth testing  particularly if a program you've just installed causes another already installed program to break and you know they both rely on the same redistributable. first  you can take a couple of basic steps. make sure that windows update has all its latest updates. if an update to the package is available  that might solve the problem. you can also try scanning for corrupt system files in windows. it doesn't take long and it can restore system files that have become corrupt or gone missing. it's always worth a shot. if those steps fail to resolve the problem  you can try uninstalling and then reinstalling the version in question. and  if you don't know the specific version  you can take a gamble and try uninstalling all the redistributable packages from your computer and then installing all the latest implementations of each version. whichever route you take  make sure you back up your computer first!you can uninstall the redistributables the same way you uninstall any other program in the programs and features control panel app. you can then download and install the latest versions from microsoft's download center. here are some direct links to each version microsoft visual c++ 2005 sp1 redistributable (x86)microsoft visual c++ 2005 sp1 redistributable (x64)microsoft visual c++ 2008 sp1 redistributable (x86)microsoft visual c++ 2008 sp1 redistributable (x64)microsoft visual c++ 2010 sp1 redistributable (x86)microsoft visual c++ 2010 sp1 redistributable (x64)microsoft visual c++ 2012 update 4 redistributable (x86 and x64)microsoft visual c++ 2013 redistributable (x86 and x64)microsoft visual c++ 2015 update 2 redistributable (x86 and x64)just remember that if you're running a 64-bit version of windows  you'll need to download and install both the 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions. and there it is. hopefully  that at least explains what these visual c++ redistributable packages are and why so many are installed on your pc. https//askleo.com/do_i_need_these_microsoft_visual_c_redistributables/ do i need these microsoft visual c++ redistributables? do i need these microsoft visual c++ redistributables? assorted redistributables and shared libraries are often installed on your pc by programs that need them. removing them  while tempting  is fairly risky.//i have an acer aspire one d255 laptop and it runs windows xp. i'm wondering if i need all of these microsoft programs on here  like microsoft visual c++ 2005 redistributable or microsoft visual c++ 2008 redistributable. it's taking up space on my hard drive and i'm wondering if those programs are really necessary. then  i was also wondering if i need all of these windows live programs on here  like windows live essentials or windows live sync. time for my most common  and yet most annoying answer…. it depends. i'll describe what the visual c++ redistributables are all about and why the safest thing to do is probably to leave them alone. as for windows live … well  that one's up to you. visual c++ redistributables when companies write software using microsoft visual c++  they make use of a number of what are called ""standard libraries"". those are collections of pre-written software provided by visual c++ for programmers to use. that way  they don't have to write what are often very common sequences of code. instead  they can use these libraries of software that are pre-written and very thoroughly tested by either years of use or microsoft's own testing efforts."" the libraries are packaged in such a way that several programs which use the same library can share one copy of the library. the libraries are packaged in such a way that several programs which use the same library can share one copy of the library. so  if you have five programs that use the microsoft visual c++ 2005 redistributable  there only needs to be one copy of it on your computer. libraries like this are not guaranteed to be on the machine to begin with so companies are allowed to ""redistribute"" the libraries (hence  the name). if the library is not already on your machine when you install the software that needs it  that software's setup program can install them as well. naturally  there is more than one version and apparently the newer one does not automatically replace the older one. much like the . net framework  you can end up with more than one version on your machine. do you need them? i have no idea if you need them. i have no idea if you need just one or both. in this case  it depends on the software on your machine. if the software that you've installed on your machine needs them … well  then you need them. if it doesn't  then you might not. but given that they only appear on your machine if software that uses them is present 1  i would expect that you probably do need them. both. and leaving them in place is by far the safest thing to do. windows live this time  it depends on you. windows live essentials is a kind of shared library – not unlike the visual c++ redistributable – that is used by the various windows live programs that you might install on your machine. so  if you use windows live mail or windows live messenger  then windows live essentials is required. on the other hand  if you never use any windows live software  you might be able to do without. using windows live hotmail via the web only  for example  doesn't install or require any windows live software on your machine. and if something stops working  windows live essentials are a quick and easy download. is it worth it? my question to you is this is it worth the time and risk to consider removing these things? my experience is that they won't give you back nearly as much disk space as you might be expecting. if you're in a true disk-space crunch  i'd approach the problem by seeing what's using the most space and attacking it from that angle. you'll get a lot more space more quickly if you approach it by looking for the biggest space hogs first. if you're not running low on disk space  i wouldn't spend any more time on it. if these items aren't being used  they're not using any system resources other than disk space. not to mention that there's always a risk of breaking something when removing components like these that are designed to be shared. there's simply no way to ensure that there are no programs that might need 'em still on your machine.•read more where's my disk space going? it's not uncommon to run out of disk space. a free utility can help tell where your disk space is going so you can determine what steps to take. what is the . net framework  and do i need all these versions? . net framework is an important support library for many programs. unfortunately  its versioning and updating leave a lot to be desired. do all these software updates take up more and more disk space? keeping up-to-date is an important part of staying safe. sometimes that means disk space is slowly used for more and more updates. and sometimes not. related terms term download footnotes and references1  in an ideal world  uninstalling the last software package that requires a particular redistributable would also uninstall that redistributable. for various reasons  that's likely not to be the case. if you uninstall software that requires a redistributable  you may be left with an unnecessary redistributable on your machine. it's probably a rare case. posted june 23  2011 in windows components shortlink https//askleo.com/4854« previous post is my information safe in the cloud?

8299545	business model canvas example	Factual	['D643026']	"Factual: https//www.cleverism.com/business-model-canvas-complete-guide/ business model canvas a complete guide a business model describes how a company creates  delivers and captures value. everyone has their unique way of viewing the business model. during discussions about this  there has been an increasing need for an uniform template to define and discuss the business model. this template should be applicable to new and old businesses alike  across industries.© flickr | marcfonteijn in this article we will look at 1) what is a business model canvas?  2) the traditional approach to a business model  3) the 9 building blocks  4) why to use the business model canvas  and 5) applying the business model canvas. what is a business model canvas? the business model canvas  developed by alexander osterwalder  is a visual representation of current or new business models  generally used by strategic managers. the canvas provides a holistic view of the business as a whole and is especially useful in running a comparative analysis on the impact of an increase in investment may have on any of the contributing factors. the business model canvas gives people a common language through which they can evaluate traditional processes and bring innovation into their business models. the traditional approach to a business modelmost startups fail because entrepreneurs put all their faith in the idea of the product the organization exists to create. in their loyalty to this product or service  they fail to give in depth consideration to the business model their organization will follow. usually the business model is either a one-size-fits-all model  common in the industry or it is a random amalgamation of systems and processes  created at the spur of the moment to further the main goal; sell the product or service. successful new ventures do not go to market with their first idea; instead  the product/ service has usually gone through several iterations before arriving at the final version. similarly  organizations are more sustainable if they have considered several business models before deciding on a particular one. business model canvas explained your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video.000 / 220the 9 building blocksthe business model canvas categorizes the processes and internal activities of a business into 9 separate categories  each representing a building block in the creation of the product or service. these categories represent the four major aspects of a business; customers  offer  infrastructure  as well as financial viability. all 9 categories are listed and explained below.1. customer segments the total customer pie is divided into segments based on the manner in which an organization's products or services address a specific need for the segment. the customer segment is an essential part of an organization's business model and is key to ensuring that the product features are aligned with the segments characteristics and needs. to carry out an effective customer segmentation  a company must first know its customers  both through their current and future needs. then the organization must list its customers in terms of priority  including a list of potential future customers. finally  the company should do a thorough assessment of its customers by understanding their strengths and weaknesses and exploring other kinds of customers who may benefit the company more if they are to focus on them. various customer segments are as below;mass market an organization opting for this type of customer segment gives itself a wide pool of potential customers because it feels that its product is a relevant need amongst the general population. a potential product for such an organization could be flour. niche market this customer segment is based on highly specific needs and unique traits of its clients. an example of an organization with a niche customer segment is louis vitton segmented organizations adopting the segmented approach create further segmentation in their main customer segment based on slight variations in the customer's demographics and resultantly  their needs. diversify an organization with a diversified market segment is flexible in the iterations of its product or service tweaking it to suit the needs of segments with dissimilar needs or traits. multi-sided platform/ market this kind of segment serves customers who have a relationship to each other  i.e. blogging sites need a large group of active bloggers to attract advertisers. and they need advertisers to create cash flow. hence  only by creating a pull with both segments will the blogging site be able to have a successful business model2. value propositions an organization's value proposition is the combination of products and services it provides to its customers. osterwalder stated that these offerings need to be unique and easily differentiated from competition. value propositions can be divided into two categories quantitative this stresses the price or efficiency of the product or service qualitative this value proposition highlights the experience and results the product and its use  produce. the value proposition provides value through a number of attributes such as customization  performance  ""getting the job done""  brand/ status  design  newness  price  cost and risk reduction  accessibility  as well as convenience/ usability. when creating your product's value proposition  the first question an entrepreneur must ask himself is  what problem he is solving through his offered product or service. then one needs to look into how the product  service or overall experience can be improved so that it provides greater value than the competition. finally  it is imperative to identify the core value that your business provides. one way to identify this value is for an owner to specify what he/ she wants customers to remember about their interaction with the company.3. channels the medium through which an organization provides its value proposition to its customer segment is known as a channel. there are various options for channels available to an organization  and the selection is based on the channel that is the quickest  most efficient with the least amount of investment required. there are two basic kinds of channels; company owned channels such as store fronts or partner channels such as distributors. a company can opt to choose either one or employ a combination of both. for an entrepreneur  the first step in dealing with channels is to identify the customer channels. touch points with customers can be limited or diverse depending on company strategy. then he/ she needs to evaluate the strength of the channel by conducting an swot analysis on the channel. finally  the company can identify and build new customer channels.4. customer relationships an organization must select the kind of relationship it will have with its customer segment in order to create financial success and sustainability. customer relationships can be categorized as follows;personal assistance in this kind of relationship the company interacts with the customer directly through an employee who provides the human touch by assisting the customer presale  during the sale and even may provide after sales services. dedicated personal assistance this kind of relationship is characterized by a very close interaction between the customer and the company through a dedicated representative who is assigned a set of clients and is personally responsible for the entire experience the customer has with the company. self-service self-service places the onus of the customer experience on the tools the company provides for the customer to serve him or herself. automated services these are customized self-service relationships where the historical preference of the customer is taken into account to improve the overall experience. communities in today's electronic age creating communities of clients allows organizations to communicate with them directly. this allows for an enhanced client experience because the community allows clients to share their experiences and come up with common challenges and solutions. co-creation the customer has a direct hand in the form the company's product or service will take. for an entrepreneur  the priority is to identify the type of relationship he/ she has with the customer. then the value of the customer must be evaluated in terms of the frequency of his expenditure on the firms product and services. loyal customers are relationships that the company should aim to invest in as they will yield steady revenue throughout the year.5. revenue streams a revenue stream is the methodology a company follows to get its customer segments to buy its product or service. a revenue stream can be created through the following ways;asset sale the company sells the right of ownership over the good to the customer. usage fee the company charges the customer for the use of its product or service. subscription fee the company charges the customer for the regular and consistent use of its product or service. lending/ leasing/ renting the customer pays to get exclusive access to the product for a time-bound period. licensing the company charges for the use of its intellectual property. brokerage fees companies or individuals that act as an intermediary between two parties charge a brokerage fee for their services. advertising a company charges for others to advertise their products using their mediums. when setting up revenue streams  it is important to recognize that an effective price for the product and/or service will be arrived at through the process of elimination. different iterations of prices should be listed and evaluated. it is important  in the end to take a break ad reflect on possible avenues open to you as a business.6. key resources these are the assets of the organization fundamental to how it provides value to its customers. resources can be categorized as human  financial  physical and intellectual. for an entrepreneur  it is important to begin with listing your resources. this gives you a clear idea of what final product or service your company needs to create for the customer and which resources are dispensable  resulting in cost savings for your company. once the final list of resources is available  the company can decide on how much it needs to invest in these key resources to operate a sustainable business.7. key activities activities that are key to producing the company's value proposition. an entrepreneur must start by listing the key activities relevant to his/her business. these activities are the most important processes that need to occur for the business model to be effective. key activities will coincide with revenue streams. now it is important to evaluate which activities are key by adding or removing some and evaluating their impact.8. key partnerships to create efficient  streamlined operations and reduce risks associated with any business model  an organization forms partnerships with its high-quality suppliers. key partnerships are the network of suppliers and partners who complement each other in helping the company create its value proposition. partnerships can be categorized as follows;strategic alliance between competitors (also known as coopetition) joint ventures and relationships between buyers and suppliers. an entrepreneur must begin by identifying its key partners followed by making future partnership plans. this can be done through an evaluation of the partnership relationship to judge which characteristics of the relationship need improvement and what kind of future partnerships will be required.9. cost structure this defines the cost of running a business according to a particular model. businesses can either be cost driven i.e. focused on minimizing investment into the business or value driven i.e. focused on providing maximum value to the customer. following are some traits of common cost structures;fixed costs costs that remain the same over a period of time variable costs as the name suggests  these costs vary according to a variance in production economies of scale costs decrease as production increases economies of scope costs are decreased by investing in businesses related to the core product. the first step for an entrepreneur is to obviously identify all costs associated with the business. a realistic understanding of the costs of the business is one of the hallmarks of a good business model. after identification  it is important to list all the costs on the canvas  so they are visually present and then create plans for each cost. some costs may be decreased through certain measures while others may go up if you decide that an investment in a particular section will result in future gains. why to use the business model canvasvisual thinking the tool allows for easy  visual representation for decision makers to ponder upon. the tool provides a neat breakdown of the major considerations impacting the business and also makes clear the direction the organization is taking through its business model. iterate quickly if a poster sized of the canvas printout is taken  it can be used in combination with sticky notes for executives to evaluate current and potential tweaks in the business model and their impact. grasp the relationship between the 9 blocks the business model canvas allows the executive team to understand how the 9 building blocks relate to each other and the different ways these relationships can be changed to increase efficiency or effectiveness. an opportunity or innovation can be spotted through the use of this tool. short and succinct the tool encourages teams to keep their suggestions short and simple enough to fit on post-it notes. easy to circulate the tool allows easy access and sharability. pictures of the completed canvas or simply physically passing it around so people can grasp its gist as well as add to it  if need be  make the canvas a very portable and convenient tool. applying the business model canvasthe biggest business model success story is apple. apple was a game changer when it introduced the i pod to the world. through i tunes  apple integrated device  software and an online store into an experience that set the music industry on its ear. even though apple was in no way the first entrant into the mp3 player market  its unique and well-executed business model ensured lasting success. this business model was in essence the seamless coming together of the key components of the business model canvas to leverage its distinctive value proposition. apple has lasting partnerships through the deals it negotiated with music producers so it could sell their music through its store. apple revenue stream comes from the sale of its i pods. however  the added benefit of the online store creates a package that competitors have been hard pressed to match. pin 7 share 119 share pocket tweet126"

that difference is almost pure profit. i believe that one of the best ways to build your coffee business is by developing an effective  customer friendly espresso drink based marketing program. by achieving that you will make more money for yourself and be in a stronger position against your competition. after twenty-seven years in this business  i have come to the conclusion that the single most important factor-besides the location- for the success of an espresso operation is whether the owner  the ceo or the person responsible for the overall project is an espresso based drink consumer himself or herself  and understands what a properly prepared drink should taste like. unfortunately  properly prepared espresso drinks are hard to find in most parts of this country. so when a prospective ceo or a future franchise owner of a bagel shop  for instance  has his or her first ""espresso experience"" at a place that has no clue  and that first sip proves to be unpleasant or indifferent  these ceo's never develop a taste for espresso and are probably wondering what all that excitement is all about. with such a mind set  espresso based drinks won't be on the priority list of many owners and espresso drinks will represent only a minor part of their revenues. most of the coffee sold will be of the ""regular"" type. this will result in lower revenues  lower customer satisfaction and the failure of providing the customer with a compelling reason to return on a daily basis. how to open a financially successful coffee  espresso & tea shop by elizabeth godsmark ( amazon usa  amazon uk   amazon canada )taste if your customers do not like the taste of your espresso based drinks because of faulty preparation techniques  they either won't order it again or won't come back. unfortunately  most of the espresso served in this country has no relation to the real thing  and the only way it can be consumed is by drowning its thin  overheated  bitter  flavorless  overpriced taste in some fancy flavored syrup. by the way  the taste of an espresso based drink has more to do with the way it is prepared  than with the coffee or equipment being used. i had some tasteless cappuccinos prepared with $11.00 a pound coffee with a $10 000 machine  and some excellent ones made from $5.00 a pound and a $3000 machine. you may be surprised to know that most of the espresso operations in this country do not understand how to properly prepare espresso based drinks. by ""properly""  i mean good tasting drinks made fast. though taste is subjective  most of the customers  when tasting the same coffee  prepared with the same machine  but one cup made ""right""  and the other made following the training guidelines of the operation  will taste the difference and prefer the ""right"" cup 95% of the time. what is the use of blending and roasting the best coffee in the world if it becomes unpalatable during the preparation stage at the retail level  and the only way it can be consumed is by drowning its bad taste with flowered syrups? what it takes to be successful to be really successful in the coffee bar business you must make coffee drinks your main product  and from these  espresso based drinks should account for at least 50% of your total sales. in many of the most profitable and successful coffee bars  espresso based drinks account for over 65% of their total gross sales. you can brew around 50 cups of regular coffee from the same pound  and sell it at $1.00 a cup. that is around $45.00 gross profit! add the cost of a paper cup  lid  sugar  cream  and that brings the cost to around 25 cents per cup. you make 75 cents a cup. now  let's go a step further suppose that most of the coffees sold are espresso based drinks  you would still pay from $5.50-$7.00 a pound for the beans and produce  on the average  around 60 shots from a pound at a cost of around 12 cents for a single shot. add for the cup  milk  etc.  and that would bring the cost of a cappuccino or latte to around 35 cents. but your sale price per cup  on the average  would be around $2.00. you make $1.65 a cup! that would make an enormous positive impact on your bottom line!sample statements here are actual statements (rounded) from two of my past stores example 1 opening cost (1981) large office & retail complex in business district (san francisco)operating cost $42 000 total build out from shell size 630 square feet opening cost $42 000 total build out from shell hours of operation 7 am – 5 pm  mon-fri. sat & sun doing one third of normal sales bean usage 120-150 pounds a week cost of cappuccino/latte $1.10 (1986)sell price (1986) $150 000food cost $6600 22.1%labor $6860 22.8% (2 ft  1 pt)rent $3000paper  supplies $1800phone $100insurance $350maint & repairs $200utilities $500refuse $150misc. $200total operating expenses $19 760profit before depreciation  taxes  repayment on loans etc. $ 10 240.

quora contributor opinions expressed by forbes contributors are their own. tech 12/20/2012 @ 1259pm 891 138 views whats the secret to a successful coffee shop? answer by peter baskerville  founder of 20 cafes and food businesses having detailed an answer to why do most café startups fail?  i guess it is only fair that i also provide an answer to the question about why some succeed. there is no one secret to a successful coffee shop; in fact  most secrets in business boil down to either hard work  extensive experience  or luck or a combination of all three. i have taken success for this post to mean financially sustainable with an appropriate roi for the owner  which means not necessarily giving the customer everything they would wish for. i have established and managed more than fifteen coffee shops with varying degrees of success. while there may be hundreds of reasons why a coffee shop might succeed (including luck)  here are the ones that i pursued in australia that lead to successful outcomes for me. consistently serving the finest espresso – it is rare in business to discover a product where consistently offering 100% quality is the best commercial decision you can make. in fact  i am the greatest advocate for the 80% is perfect model. but espresso coffee is one of those rare products where consistent 100% quality matters. customers will walk past ten other competitors to get the best espresso  which is why this factor alone means you don't need the highly visible  most expensive location. so buy the best espresso coffee machine (3/4 group italian made with e61 groupheads and set to the right pump and temperature levels)  install it with a water purifier and demineralizer  use a conical grinder  and only buy top quality arabica or arabica 90%/robusta 10% freshly roasted beans  and make sure every cup is made by a fully trained barista who is continually seeking the 'god shot.'ergonomics is vital – make sure the coffee workstation and layout is such that the barista hardly moves their feet in performing all their coffee making duties  and they are not competing for the space with other staff members. high volume coffee sales are the foundation stone of every coffee shop  so make sure this workstation is perfectly laid out with easy access to underneath bins  bean storage  and bar fridge milk  having the right height benchtop with easy access to cups  grinder  accessories  and reachable overhead storage of supplies. the best setups also have a small inbuilt sink to allow for quick and easy ongoing cleaning. also  place the cash register on the front counter in close proximity to the barista's workstation. this allows the barista to hear the customer orders and get a head start on making them in the busy times  while allowing the barista to work alone in an efficient way in the very slow times. use loyalty cards – i resisted using these for a long time … but they really do work. make sure it is a quality card that will last the wear and tear and look good in a customer's wallet. nothing better than seeing a new customer's face light up when you give them a buy seven get the eighth one free loyalty card  but tick off six of them so that on their very next purchase they get a free one. cheapest customer acquisition ever. promote multiple sales – a coffee shop will never make enough money to pay the bills from coffee sales alone. coffee may be the prime motivator for customers coming to the business  but they must leave with multiple sales if you are going to be successful. as a target  coffee should be no more than 40% of your weekly sales and two item sales per customer transaction means you are getting it about right. so make sure the traditional coffee accompaniments (muffins  cookies  cakes) are close by at the point of sale  and the coffee shop offers cold food  cold drinks  and hot food to ensure the best chance of multiple sales. limit the assortment – many newbies in the coffee shop game think that wide assortments and extensive product offers are a key competitive advantage. they forget that the customer is simply hungry or thirsty or both  and that a wide choice for most people creates anguish. so cover the necessary categories  but with limited and strategic offers. (e.g. three flavors are enough  three sizes are enough  three types of food/drink are enough). every item you add to the assortment creates many multiples of management effort (costs) and mostly without adding anything to the revenue streams or customer experience. merchandise your margins – price according to perceived customer value  not according to accounting determined markups. for some well known items you will need to be at (coffee) or even below market price (coke can)  and this loss should be made up with high margins on other items that are exclusive to you or in the 'don't-care and addictive' mindset of your customers. so don't add a blanket markup to your entire assortment  but price line by line according to customer expectations and what the market will bear. get your beachhead strategies right – getting traction in a competitive marketplace like coffee shops is vital  and you will need to have a clear understanding of how to get customers to initially give you a go and a plan for keeping them returning and referring you to their friends. this is a whole other topic that i have now written about here … what are some biz dev best practices for startups?. counter service – counter service is the cheapest most efficient and effective service system for a coffee shop  and it is now fully accepted by customers  thanks to the global success of mc donalds. counter service is hassle free for both you and your customer  and it significantly reduces your wages bill. so get the customers to order and pay upfront  give them a number on a stand with their drinks  and deliver the food or better still give them a buzzer that calls them up to the counter when the food is ready. counter service means that you can handle the peak demands that occur in coffee shops at breakfast and lunch  and it is a lot less stressful on everyone  ensuring the friendly banter can remain an important part of your offer. pre-make as much as possible – custom-made assortments assume that the customers know precisely what they want. they don't. customers see you as the expert and are hoping that you will suggest to them what combination of food/drinks they should be trying. in a coffee shop context  i found it best to pre-make the food and leave the custom making to the coffee. custom food is also a high cost option for you because you can't get the economies of scale making-to-order  and it limits your turnover in those peak periods where you should be busy pumping out the sales as quickly as possible  not spending the time making custom orders. understand what you are really selling – too many businesses  including coffee shop owners  don't fully understand the need they are really satisfying for their customers  and so they often concentrate on the wrong parts of their offer. customers frequent a coffee shop for many more reasons than just hunger and thirst. there is the escape from a stressful office  the chance to maintain or grow a relationship  a place to get away to do some reflective work  a chance to engage with familiar coffee shop staff at a particularly lonely time  or as a place to do business and reach an agreement. understanding the needs you are really catering to will help you better construct your offer and make decisions that keep your customers returning and so maintaining the coffee shop's success. target takeaways – i know all your friends will tell you to get comfortable lounges  free wi-fi  table service  and lots of in-house entertainment … but customers sitting on one cup of coffee for hours enjoying all these benefits won't pay your rent. my most financially successful coffee shops had a limited number of not-so-comfortable bench & bar stools to make the coffee shop look lived in and loved  but i concentrated on building the takeaway business. takeaway customers pay the same price as the sit-down customer  but without any of the occupancy costs  and you will serve ten of them by the time your sit down customer has finished sipping on their first cup of coffee as they enjoy a chat with their friends on facebook using your free wi-fi. serve on the front line - coffee shops  like restaurants  are much more a people/service business than they are a goods/transactional one. while a goods/transactional business can still succeed with a non-present owner  a coffee shop needs the owner's care  attention  and engagement. customers expect it  and staff are far more enlivened when the owner in on hand taking orders or making coffee or is generally hovering in active care of the business. probably worth mentioning why i haven't included high traffic location on the list. the reason is that it doesn't necessarily work for coffee. sure  you have to be located in the area where there are a sufficient number of people  but you don't need the high traffic location in that area. for a start  it will carry the most expensive rent  secondly you will be competing for that space with a1 tenants (banks  telcos  fashion houses  franchise chains)  making it near impossible to get as a stand alone coffee shop business anyway and thirdly  high traffic dose not always translate into high turnover for coffee. i made that mistake once  failing to realize that coffee is a destination rather than an impulse purchase and too much traffic can mean that people are more focused on getting somewhere else rather than stopping to enjoy your offer. believe me  my #1 will overcome the need to get that high traffic location  and the lower rent will make your coffee shop far more financially sustainable and successful. this is not an exhaustive list but it will give you some ideas on what you should be considering if you want to build a successful coffee shop. see also what is it like to own/run a coffee shop?  which provides further insights into the coffee shop business.…jacob jaber  ceo of philz coffee1. passionate people who start it because they are passionate and talented with coffee  not because they want to start a business.2. product that tastes better than any other nearby.3. don't act like you're in the coffee business. when you're in retail  you're in the people business. a lot of the other things usually take care of themselves. this question originally appeared on quora. more questions on small businesses why do most café startups fail? who are the real ""job creators""? as an entrepreneur  what's the best bit of advice you've been given?"
9853781	caduceus healthcare	Factual	['D418234', 'D289525']	"Factual: https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caduceus_as_a_symbol_of_medicine caduceus as a symbol of medicine from wikipedia  the free encyclopedianavigation search this article is about the greek symbol. for the medical symbol often mistakenly referred to as a caduceus  see rod of asclepius. the us army medical corps branch plaque. the adoption  in 1902  of the caduceus for us army medical officer uniforms popularized the erroneous use of the symbol throughout the medical field in the united states. the caduceus is the traditional symbol of hermes and features two snakes winding around an often winged staff. it is often mistakenly used as a symbol of medicine instead of the rod of asclepius  especially in the united states. the two-snake caduceus design has ancient and consistent associations with trade  eloquence  negotiation  alchemy and wisdom. the modern use of the caduceus as a symbol of medicine became established in the united states in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of documented mistakes  misunderstandings and confusion. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] note a [›]contents [ hide ]1 early use in a possible medical context2 adoption by the us military3 contemporary views4 see also5 notes6 references early use in a possible medical context [ edit]see also rod of asclepius before the ancient romans and greeks (about 2612 bce )  older representations from syria and india of sticks and animals looking like serpents or worms are interpreted as a direct representation of traditional treatment of dracunculiasis  the guinea worm disease. [6]while there is ample historical evidence of the use of the caduceus  or heralds staff  to represent hermes or mercury (and by extension commerce and negotiation)  early evidence of any symbolic association between the caduceus and medicine or medical practice is scarce and ambiguous. it is likely linked to the alchemical universal solvent  azoth  the symbol of which was the caduceus. the guildhall museum in london holds a 3rd-century oculist s seal with caduceus symbols both top and bottom. the seal was apparently used to mark preparations of eye medicine. [7] it is believed likely that rather than being evidence of a medical association per se  this is rather an allusion to the words of the greek poet homer who described the caduceus as possessing the ability to charm the eyes of men  which of course relates to the business of an oculist. [7]walter friedlander proposed that early association of the caduceus with medicine might have derived from the association of hermes trismegistus (thrice-great hermes) with early chemistry and medicine as aspects of alchemy as an esoteric practice. he notes however  that although these various factors may link hermes/mercury  along with his caduceus  with alchemical medicine  they may just as well link all the other non-medical aspects of alchemy with hermes/mercury and the caduceus. [1]beginning with the 16th century there is limited evidence of the use of the caduceus in what is arguably a medical context. however  this evidence is also ambiguous. in some cases it is clear that the caduceus symbolized wisdom  without any specific medical connotations. [1]the printers device of johann froben. the caduceus appears in a general medical context in the printers device used by the swiss medical printer johann frobenius (1460–1527)  who depicted the staff entwined with serpents and surmounted by a dove  with a biblical epigraph in greek  be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves (matthew 1016  here in the kjv translation)  [3] in keeping with the connotations of the caduceus as a symbol of messengers and publishers based on the association of hermes or mercury with eloquence and negotiation. friedlander observed that frobenius could hardly be considered a medical printer  as had previously been asserted  noting that in a review of 257 of the works bearing this printers device only one was related to medicine. similar use of the caduceus in printers marks continues to the present day  with companies including f. a. davis company still using the symbol as an element of their insignia. there are a few other examples of use in this period. it may have been used as a symbol by sir william butts  physician to henry viii. [3] similarly  physician john caius  founder of caius college  cambridge  and at the time president of the royal college of physicians  during official visits to his eponymous college  had carried before him a silver caduceus on a cushion  and later presented this artefact to the college  where it remains in the colleges possession. [8] this use was adduced by the medical historian (and primary apologist for the use of the caduceus in a medical context) fielding garrison to support his argument that the caduceus was used as a symbol of medicine as far back as the 16th century. however  as walter friedlander noted  what caius used was a non-specific heralds wand  rather than the caduceus of hermes. in support of this assertion he quotes caiuss own words on why he chose a heralds wand as a symbol  making it clear that he chose it as a symbol of prudence. [1] this same passage was also earlier referenced by engle in refuting garrisons claim. engle and friedlander are not the only ones to have noted that the use of the caduceus by caius had nothing to do with supposed medical symbolism; as indicated in a publication produced by the royal college of physicians itself  [...] by introducing the caduceus into the ceremony of the college of physicians  caius unintentionally added to the confusion between the two emblems for later times  when few people understand the visual signs with which he was so familiar. [9]in support of the idea that the caduceus had a long-standing association with medicine  garrison also mentioned the fact that the english medical printer churchill used the symbol as a printers device  beginning some time around 1844. friedlander has examined this subject in detail  and shows that churchill was well aware that the rod of asclepius was the accepted symbol of medicine. he is  it seems  inclined to think that the adoption of the caduceus in this context probably had something to do with the relation between publishing and the role of mercury as a messenger and scribe. he notes  however that john churchill adopted the caduceus as his printers device independent of any idea that it symbolized medicine does not mean that  once having adopted it  it did not play some role in the caduceus coming to be accepted as a symbol of medicine  at least in the united states. during the remaining part of the nineteenth century several united states publishers appear to have copied or modified churchills caduceus and placed this mark on their medical books. other contemporary british publishers did not use a caduceus and the caduceus had never been as widely connected to medicine in great britain or in europe as it has been in the united states.— walter j friedlander  the golden wand of medicine a history of the caduceus symbol in medicine [1]in any case  in great britain  as late as 1854  the distinction between the rod of asclepius and the caduceus as symbols of two very different professions was apparently still quite clear. in his article on tradesmens signs of london a. h. burkitt notes that among the very old symbols still used in london at that time  which were based on associations between pagan gods and professions  we find mercury  or his caduceus  appropriate in trade  as indicating expedition. esculapius  his serpent and staff  or his cock  for professors of the healing art [10]adoption by the us military [ edit]widespread confusion regarding the supposed medical significance apparently arose as a result of events in the united states that occurred in the second half of the 19th century. [5] as pointed out by garrison  the caduceus had appeared on the chevrons of army hospital stewards as early as 1856 [11] (william k. emerson indicates the insignia was adopted earlier  in 1851). it has been asserted that this was a result of ignorance or misinterpretation regarding the pre-existing designation of the rod of asclepius by the surgeon general of the united states for this purpose. [7] it is worth noting that hospital stewards were not physicians; they played a supporting role preparing drugs for surgeons  supervising nurses and cooks  maintaining accounting and medical records  and in emergencies sometimes performed minor surgery or provided prescriptions. [12]later  in 1871  the surgeon general designated the caduceus as the seal of the marine hospital service (destined to become the u. s. public health service in 1912). gershen states that the change was for aesthetic reasons  [13] whereas friedlander states the caduceus was adopted by the marine hospital service because of its relationship with merchant seamen and the maritime industry. [1]the caduceus was formally adopted by the medical department of the united states army in 1902 and was added to the uniforms of army medical officers. according to friedlander  this was brought about by one captain frederick p. reynolds  although bernice engle states the use of the caduceus in our army i believe to be due chiefly to the late colonel hoff  who has emphasized the suitability of the caduceus as an emblem of neutrality. [3] reynolds had the idea rejected several times by the surgeon general  but persuaded the new incumbent — brig. gen. william h. forwood — to adopt it. this resulted in considerable controversy. the army and navy register of 28 june 1902 discusses the argument  which reflects the fact that a number of medical officers were unhappy with the choice. the article editor claims that the symbol was not chosen for its medical connotations and proposes the following symbolic interpretation the rod represents power  the serpents stand for wisdom and the two wings imply diligence and activity  qualities which are undoubtedly possessed by our medical officers. [14] the editor also points out that the majority of medical corps personnel are not even doctors. according to this line of reasoning  the caduceus was never intended to be a symbol of medicine. the inconsistency was noticed several years later by the librarian to the surgeon general  but for reasons which are not entirely clear  the symbol was not changed. [5]considerable light is shed on this confusion by an anonymous letter republished by emerson  a historian of united states army insignia and uniforms. he indicates that the april 1924 issue of the military surgeon printed a review of an earlier article that appeared in the presse medicale in which the author stated there is nothing in history to justify the use of the caduceus as the emblem of the physician [...] it is most unfortunate that the confusion exists. in an anonymous rebuttal contained in a letter to the editor published three months later in the military surgeon it was claimed that the late col. john r. van hoff was a member of the board that selected the emblem (if he was not the one who was chiefly instrumental in its adoption). in the letter to the editor reproduced by emerson  the anonymous author claims"" hoff was far too scholarly and intelligent a man to commit the blunder of confusing the caduceus with the serpent staff of aesculapius. the sign of mercury was deliberately adopted  as i have heard him state  because it was the emblem of the merchant and hence the emblem of the noncombatant. in junctures when it was necessary for a vessel to proclaim its nature  it was customary for a merchant vessel to indicate its noncombatant status by flying a flag which bore the emblem of mercury  the god of the merchant. the caduceus  in our use of it  is not distinctively the emblem of the physician  but the emblem of the whole medical department. the enlisted men of the medical department outnumber the physicians of that department. besides the ambulance wagons  many vehicles are employed in field service in war which are not distinctively medical  but which are used for medical purposes. both the enlisted men and the vehicles of the department (not to mention many other objects)  should bear some sign of neutralization for protection. it seemed to colonel hoff and to the board that the geneva cross  which in addition to its use as an emblem of neutrality is also the emblem of the swiss republic  there might well be substituted an emblem which is not the emblem of a foreign country  and the caduceus was selected  as the emblem which for many ages has served to indicate the noncombatant. ""— william k emerson  encyclopedia of united states army insignia and uniforms [14]according to this view the caduceus was not intended to be a medical symbol (and  though explained differently  this reflects the view advanced by the editor commenting in the army and navy register of 28 june 1902 discussed above). nevertheless  after world war i the caduceus was employed as an emblem by both the army medical department and the navy hospital corps. even the american medical association used the symbol for a time  but in 1912  after considerable discussion  the caduceus was abandoned by the ama and the rod of asclepius was adopted instead. [3]this shift back to use of the rod of asclepius to symbolize medicine can also be seen in the united states military. the army medical corps  having popularised the caduceus  whilst retaining the caduceus for its own plaque and insignia  is now part of the army medical department  which has since adopted the rod of asclepius as its main symbol. furthermore  when the u. s. air force designed new medical insignia  it also adopted the rod of asclepius. (the royal air force (uk) medical services have  however  used the caduceus as uniform collar insignia since the foundation of the raf in 1918. [15])contemporary views [ edit]the emergency services star of life features a rod of asclepius. despite widespread acceptance of the caduceus as a medical symbol in the united states  it has been observed that the rod of asclepius has the more ancient and authentic claim to be the emblem of medicine. [16] most attempts to defend its use in a medical context date from the last quarter of the 19th century through the first quarter of the 20th  and have been characterized as based on flimsy and pseudo-historical research. [7]in a survey of 242 logos used by organizations related to health or medicine  friedlander found that professional associations were more likely to display the rod of asclepius (62%)  while organizations with a commercial focus were more likely to use the caduceus (76%). hospitals were an exception (37% used a staff of asclepius whereas 63% used a caduceus). friedlander felt it likely that this might reflect the fact that professional medical organizations have more often sought a real understanding of the meaning of the two symbols whereas commercial organizations have been less interested in the historical basis of their logo or insignia and more concerned with how well a certain symbol will be recognized by the iconographically unsophisticated audience they are trying to attract to their wares. [1]the use of the caduceus in a medical context has long been frowned upon by many professionals  academics and others who are familiar with the historical significance of both symbols. this has occasioned impassioned remarks by those frustrated with the continuing confusion."" it is hard to trust a profession that cannot even get its symbols straight. most physicians in the united states think that the symbol of their profession is something called the caduceus. but this is actually not true. [...] historians have discovered that someone in the u. s. army medical corps mistook the caduceus for the aesculapion and introduced the medical corps symbol at the beginning of the twentieth century. soon thereafter  everyone in the united states was emulating the mistake. ""— daniel p. sulmasy  a balm for gilead meditations on spirituality and the healing arts [17]it has been observed that the caduceus is particularly inappropriate for use as a medical symbol due to its long associations with the greek god hermes  who was patron of commerce and traders as well as thieves  liars  and gamblers. [18]"" as god of the high-road and the market-place hermes was perhaps above all else the patron of commerce and the fat purse as a corollary  he was the special protector of the traveling salesman. as spokesman for the gods  he not only brought peace on earth (occasionally even the peace of death)  but his silver-tongued eloquence could always make the worse appear the better cause. from this latter point of view  would not his symbol be suitable for certain congressmen  all medical quacks  book agents and purveyors of vacuum cleaners  rather than for the straight-thinking  straight-speaking therapeutist? as conductor of the dead to their subterranean abode  his emblem would seem more appropriate on a hearse than on a physicians car. ""— stuart l. tyson  the caduceus  in the scientific monthly [2]on the other hand  it has also been remarked – not without considerable irony – that commercial aims in medicine  especially in the united states of america  make the caduceus an appropriate symbol  at least for some physicians."" well  so much for the caduceus. somebody obviously got the wrong symbol for modern medicine–or did they? the caduceus seems to be an appropriate symbol for modern commercial medicine. of particular relevance are the functions of escorting souls of the dead  wisdom  fertility  commerce  luck  eloquence  cheating and thieving. these have become symbolic of how medicine evolved in the late twentieth century. ""— luke van orden  where have all the healers gone?  a doctors recovery journey [19]the caduceus and the rod of asclepius as used by neighboring offices (ridgewood  ny)others are unapologetic about the association of medicine with commerce  recognizing the importance of advertising essential for competitive marketing  and suggesting that it is up to individual physicians to choose between the two symbols  based on their own views about what associations are appropriate. [20] in 2009  conspiracy theorist david icke suggested that the american medical association deliberately adopted the symbol due to their underlying profit motives  [21] although the ama has used the rod of asclepius for over a century  [22] and its current logo since 2005. [23]in north america  there are calls to clarify the symbol and to move to a uniform use of the rod of asclepius. for example  the director of communications of the minnesota medical association is quoted as saying  if its got wings on it  its not really the symbol of medicine; some may find it hard to believe  but its true. its something like using the logo for the national rifle association when referring to the audubon society . [24]however  andrew weil  a proponent of alternative medicine  has suggested that the caduceus is appropriate as a medical symbol because it embodies an esoteric truth that must be grasped to gain practical control over the shifting forces that determine health and illness.

[3]some accounts suggest that the oldest known imagery of the caduceus have their roots in a mesopotamian origin with the sumerian god ningishzida whose symbol  a staff with two snakes intertwined around it  dates back to 4000 b. c. to 3000 b. c. [4]as a symbolic object  it represents hermes (or the roman mercury)  and by extension trades  occupations  or undertakings associated with the god. in later antiquity  the caduceus provided the basis for the astrological symbol representing the planet mercury. thus  through its use in astrology  alchemy  and astronomy it has come to denote the planet and elemental metal of the same name. it is said the wand would wake the sleeping and send the awake to sleep. if applied to the dying  their death was gentle; if applied to the dead  they returned to life. [5]by extension of its association with mercury and hermes  the caduceus is also a recognized symbol of commerce and negotiation  two realms in which balanced exchange and reciprocity are recognized as ideals. [6] [7] this association is ancient  and consistent from the classical period to modern times. [8] the caduceus is also used as a symbol representing printing  again by extension of the attributes of mercury (in this case associated with writing and eloquence). the caduceus is often incorrectly used as a symbol of healthcare organizations and medical practice  particularly in north america  due to confusion with the traditional medical symbol  the rod of asclepius  which has only one snake and is never depicted with wings. contents [ hide ]1 origin and comparative mythology1.1 ancient near east1.2 india2 classical antiquity2.1 mythology2.2 iconography3 modern use3.1 symbol of commerce3.2 confusion with rod of asclepius4 see also5 notes6 further reading7 external links origin and comparative mythology [ edit]further information serpent worship hermes hastens bearing his kerukeion  on an atticlekythos  c. 475 bc  attributed to the tithonos painter iris with the caduceus in detail from an attic red-figure pelike  middle of fifth century bc ( agrigento  sicily)it is thought that this symbols long lasting association with the medical profession stems from early use of twigs to draw out long bodied inter muscular parasitic worms by wrapping them slowly around the twig so as not to break them or allow them to escape back into the body  a successful treatment still in use today  see dracunculiasis. [ citation needed]the term kerukeion denoted any heralds staff  not necessarily associated with hermes in particular. [9]in his study of the cult of hermes  lewis richard farnell (1909) assumed that the two snakes had simply developed out of ornaments of the shepherds crook used by heralds as their staff. [10] this view has been rejected by later authors pointing to parallel iconography in the ancient near east. it has been argued that the staff or wand entwined by two snakes was itself representing a god in the pre-anthropomorphic era. like the herm or priapus  it would thus be a predecessor of the anthropomorphic hermes of the classical era. [11]ancient near east [ edit]caduceus symbol on a punch-marked coin of king ashoka in india  third to second century bcwilliam hayes ward (1910) discovered that symbols similar to the classical caduceus sometimes appeared on mesopotamian cylinder seals. he suggested the symbol originated some time between 3000 and 4000 bc  and that it might have been the source of the greek caduceus. [12] a. l. frothingham incorporated dr. wards research into his own work  published in 1916  in which he suggested that the prototype of hermes was an oriental deity of babylonian extraction represented in his earliest form as a snake god. from this perspective  the caduceus was originally representative of hermes himself  in his early form as the underworld god ningishzida  messenger of the earth mother. [13] the caduceus is mentioned in passing by walter burkert [14] as really the image of copulating snakes taken over from ancient near eastern tradition. in egyptian iconography  the djed pillar is depicted as containing a snake in a frieze of the dendera temple complex. india [ edit]the caduceus also appears as a symbol of the punch-marked coins of the maurya empire in india  in the third or second century bc. numismatic research suggest that this symbol was the symbol of the buddhist king ashoka  his personal  mudra . [15] this symbol was not used on the pre-mauryan punch-marked coins  but only on coins of the maurya period  together with the three arched-hill symbol  the peacock on the hill  the triskelis and the taxila mark. [16]classical antiquity [ edit]mythology [ edit]punishment of ixion in the center is mercury holding the caduceus and on the right juno sits on her throne. behind her iris stands and gestures. on the left is vulcan ( blond figure) standing behind the wheel  manning it  with ixion already tied to it. nephele sits at mercurys feet; a roman fresco from the eastern wall of the triclinium in the house of the vettii  pompeii  fourth style (60-79 ad). the homeric hymn to hermes relates how hermes offered his lyre fashioned from a tortoise shell as compensation for the cattle he stole from his half brother apollo. apollo in return gave hermes the caduceus as a gesture of friendship. [17] the association with the serpent thus connects hermes to apollo  as later the serpent was associated with asclepius  the son of apollo. [18]the association of apollo with the serpent is a continuation of the older indo-european dragon -slayer motif. wilhelm heinrich roscher (1913) pointed out that the serpent as an attribute of both hermes and asclepius is a variant of the pre-historic semi-chthonic serpent hero known at delphi as python   who in classical mythology is slain by apollo. [19]one greek myth of origin of the caduceus is part of the story of tiresias  [20] who found two snakes copulating and killed the female with his staff. tiresias was immediately turned into a woman  and so remained until he was able to repeat the act with the male snake seven years later. this staff later came into the possession of the god hermes  along with its transformative powers. another myth suggests that hermes (or mercury) saw two serpents entwined in mortal combat. separating them with his wand he brought about peace between them  and as a result the wand with two serpents came to be seen as a sign of peace. [21]in rome  livy refers to the caduceator who negotiated peace arrangements under the diplomatic protection of the caduceus he carried. [22]iconography [ edit]in some vase paintings ancient depictions of the greek kerukeion are somewhat different from the commonly seen modern representation. these representations feature the two snakes atop the staff (or rod)  crossed to create a circle with the heads of the snakes resembling horns. this old graphic form  with an additional crossbar to the staff  seems to have provided the basis for the graphical sign of mercury (☿) used in greek astrology from late antiquity. [23]modern use [ edit]caduceus on the coat of arms of jyväskylä  finland the caduceus as an astrological symbol customs flag of china  with a caduceus at the lower right corner crossing with a golden key caduceus is encoded in unicode at code point u+2624 ☤. symbol of commerce [ edit]a simplified variant of the caduceus is to be found in dictionaries  indicating a ""commercial term"" entirely in keeping with the association of hermes with commerce. in this form the staff is often depicted with two winglets attached and the snakes are omitted (or reduced to a small ring in the middle). [24] the customs service of the former german democratic republic employed the caduceus  bringing its implied associations with thresholds  translators  and commerce  in the service medals they issued their staff. the caduceus is also the symbol of the customs agency of bulgaria. the emblem of the china customs is a caduceus crossing with a golden key. [25]confusion with rod of asclepius [ edit]main article caduceus as a symbol of medicine the us army medical corps branch plaque. the adoption  in 1902  of the caduceus for us army medical officer uniforms popularized the use of the symbol throughout the medical field in the united states. rod of asclepius it is relatively common  especially in the united states  to find the caduceus  with its two snakes and wings  used as a symbol of medicine instead of the rod of asclepius  with only a single snake. this usage was popularised largely as a result of the adoption of the caduceus as its insignia by the u. s. army medical corps in 1902 at the insistence of a single officer (though there are conflicting claims as to whether this was capt. frederick p. reynolds or col. john r. van hoff). [26] [27]the rod of asclepius is the dominant symbol for professional healthcare associations in the united states. one survey found that 62% of professional healthcare associations used the rod of asclepius as their symbol. [28] the same survey found that 76% of commercial healthcare organizations used the caduceus symbol. the author of the study suggests the difference exists because professional associations are more likely to have a real understanding of the two symbols  whereas commercial organizations are more likely to be concerned with the visual impact a symbol will have in selling their products. the long-standing and abundantly attested historical associations of the caduceus with commerce are considered by many to be inappropriate in a symbol used by those engaged in the healing arts. [27] this has occasioned significant criticism of the use of the caduceus in a medical context."" as god of the high-road and the market-place hermes was perhaps above all else the patron of commerce and the fat purse as a corollary  he was the special protector of the traveling salesman. as spokesman for the gods  he not only brought peace on earth (occasionally even the peace of death)  but his silver-tongued eloquence could always make the worse appear the better cause.

[1]large numbers of young men and women came alone as indentured servants. their passage was paid by employers in the colonies who needed help on the farms or in shops. indentured servants were provided food  housing  clothing and training but they did not receive wages. at the end of the indenture (usually around age 21) they were free to marry and start their own farms. [2]new england [ edit]seeking religious freedom in the new world  one hundred english pilgrims established a small settlement near plymouth  massachusetts in 1620. tens of thousands of english puritans arrived  mostly from the east anglian parts of england ( norfolk  suffolk  essex )  as well as kent and east sussex .  [3] and settled in boston  massachusetts and adjacent areas from around 1629 to 1640 to create a land dedicated to their religion. the earliest new english colonies  massachusetts  connecticut  rhode island  and new hampshire  were established along the northeast coast. large scale immigration to this region ended before 1700  though a small but steady trickle of later arrivals continued. [4]the new english colonists were the most urban and educated of all their contemporaries  and they had many skilled farmers  tradesmen and craftsmen among them. they started the first university  harvard  in 1635 in order to train their ministers. they mostly settled in small villages for mutual support (nearly all of them had their own militias) and common religious activities. shipbuilding  commerce  agriculture  and fishing were their main sources of income. new englands healthy climate (the cold winters killed the mosquitoes and other disease-bearing insects)  small widespread villages (minimizing the spread of disease)  and an abundant food supply resulted in the lowest death rate and the highest birth rate of any of the colonies. the eastern and northern frontier around the initial new england settlements was mainly settled by the descendants of the original new englanders. immigration to the new england colonies after 1640 and the start of the english civil war decreased to less than 1% (about equal to the death rate) in nearly all of the years prior to 1845. the rapid growth of the new england colonies (approximately 900 000 by 1790) was almost entirely due to the high birth rate (>3%) and the low death rate (<1%) per year. [5]dutch [ edit]the dutch  primarily driven by the united east indian company  first established settlements along the hudson river in new york starting about 1626. wealthy dutch patroons set up large landed estates along the hudson river and brought in farmers who became renters. others established rich trading posts to trade with native americans and started cities such as new amsterdam (now new york city) and albany  new york. [6] after the british took over and renamed the colony new york  germans (from the palatinate )  and yankees (from new england) began arriving. [7]middle colonies [ edit]maryland  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  and delaware formed the middle colonies. pennsylvania was settled by quakers from britain  followed by ulster scots (northern ireland) on the frontier and numerous german protestant sects  including the german palatines. the earlier colony of new sweden had small settlements on the lower delaware river  with immigrants of swedes and finns. these colonies were absorbed by 1676. [8]the middle colonies were scattered west of new york city (established 1626; taken over by the english in 1664) and philadelphia  pennsylvania (established 1682). the initially dutch colony of new york had the most eclectic collection of residents from many different nations and prospered as a major trading and commercial center after about 1700. from around 1680 to 1725  the pennsylvania colonial center was dominated by the quakers for decades after they emigrated  mainly from the north midlands of england. during this time  the main commercial center of philadelphia was run mostly by prosperous quakers  supplemented by many small farming and trading communities  with a strong german contingent located in several small towns in the delaware river valley. [9]starting around 1680  when pennsylvania was founded  many more settlers arrived to the middle colonies. many protestant sects were encouraged to settle there for freedom of religion and good  cheap land. their origins were about 60% british and 33% german. by 1780  new yorks population were around 27% descendants of dutch settlers  about 6% were black  and the remainder were mostly english with a wide mixture of other europeans. new jersey  and delaware had a british majority  with 7–11% german-descendants  about 6% black population  and a small contingent of the swedish descendants of new sweden. frontier [ edit]the colonial frontier was mainly settled from about 1717 to 1775. these were mostly presbyterian settlers from north england border lands  scotland  and ulster  fleeing hard times and religious persecution. [10] the fourth major center of settlement was the western frontier  located in the western parts of pennsylvania and in the south  which was settled during the early to late 18th century by mostly scots-irish  with others mostly from north england border lands. some french huguenots and germans were also present. between 250 000 and 400 000 scotch-irish migrated to america in the 18th century. [10] the scotch-irish soon became the dominant culture of the appalachians from pennsylvania to georgia. areas where people reported  american  ancestry were the places where  historically  northern english  scottish and scotch-irish protestants settled in the interior of the south  and the appalachian region. [11] scotch-irish american immigrants  were made up of people from the southernmost counties of scotland who had initially settled in ireland. they were heavily presbyterian  largely self-sufficient  and generally hostile to native americans and catholics. [ citation needed] the scotch-irish arrived in large numbers during the early 18th century and they often preferred to settle in the back country and the frontier from pennsylvania to georgia  where they mingled with second generation and later english settlers. they enjoyed the very cheap land and independence from established governments common to frontier settlements. often  the main port of entry for these immigrants was philadelphia  after which they (or  in many cases  their descendants) migrated west and south. southern colonies [ edit]the mostly agricultural southern english colonies initially had very high death rates for new settlers due to malaria  yellow fever  and other diseases as well as skirmishes with native americans. despite this  a steady flow of new settlers  mostly from central england and the london area  kept up population growth. initially  the large plantations were mostly owned by friends (mostly minor aristocrats) of the british-appointed governors. a group of gaelic-speaking scottish highlanders created a settlement at cape fear in north carolina  which remained culturally distinct until the mid-18th century  at which point it was swallowed up by the dominant english-origin culture. [ citation needed] many settlers arrived as indentured servants who had to work off their passage with five to seven years of work for room and board  clothing  and training  but no cash wages. after their terms of indentures expired  most of the indentures settled small farms on the frontier. the southern colonies were about 55% british  38% black  and roughly 7% german. [ citation needed] the atlantic slave trade primarily ceased after 1775 and it was outlawed in 1808  although some slaves were smuggled in afterwards. after 1630  the initial areas of settlement had been largely cleared of native americans by major outbreaks of measles  smallpox  and bubonic plague beginning decades before the settlers began arriving in large numbers. the leading killer was smallpox  which arrived in the new world around 1510–1530. [12]characteristics [ edit]while the thirteen colonies differentiated in how they were settled and by whom  they had many commonalities. nearly all were settled and financed by privately organized british settlers or families using free enterprise without any significant english royal or parliamentary government support or input. nearly all commercial activity was run in small  privately owned businesses with good credit both at home and in england  which was essential since they were often cash poor. most settlements were nearly independent of british trade since they grew or made nearly everything they needed; the average cost of imports per household was 5–15 pounds per year. most settlements were created by complete family groups with several generations often present. the population was typically rural  with close to 80% owning the land they lived and farmed on. after 1700  as the industrial revolution progressed  more of the population started to move to cities  much like what had happened in britain. initially  the dutch and german americans primarily spoke dialects brought over from europe  while english was the main trade language. governments and laws primarily copied the english. the only major british institution to be abandoned was the aristocracy  noted by nearly universal absence. the settlers generally established their own popularly elected governments and courts on as many levels as they could and were nearly all  within a few years  self-governing  self-supporting  and self-replicating. this self-ruling pattern became so ingrained that almost all new settlements would have their own government up and running shortly after arrival for the next 200 years. after the colonies were initially settled  their population growth was made up almost entirely of natural growth with foreign-born immigrant populations rarely exceeding 10% (except in isolated instances). the last significant colonies to be settled primarily by immigrants were pennsylvania (1680s+)  the carolinas (1663+)  and georgia (1732+). even here the immigrants came mostly from england and scotland with the exception of a large germanic contingent to pennsylvania. elsewhere internal american migration from other colonies provided nearly all of the settlers for each new colony or state. [13] populations grew by about 80% at a 3% natural annual growth rate sustained over a 20-year interval. over half of all new british immigrants in the south initially arrived as indentured servants. [14] they were mostly poor young people who couldnt find work in england and couldnt afford passage to america and. in addition  about 60 000 british convicts were transported to the new british colonies in georgia in the 18th century. most of these so-called convicts were guilty of being very poor and out of work. serious criminals were generally executed. ironically  these convicts are often the only immigrants with nearly complete immigration records as other immigrants typically showed up with few or no records. [15]other colonies [ edit]spanish [ edit]although spain set up a few forts in florida  notably san agustín (present-day saint augustine) in 1565  they sent few settlers to florida. spaniards moving north from mexico founded the san juan on the rio grande in 1598  and santa fe in 1607–1608. the settlers were forced to leave temporarily for 12 years (1680–1692) by the pueblo revolt before returning. spanish texas lasted from 1690 to 1821 when texas was governed as a colony which was separate from new spain. in 1731  canary islanders (or isleños) arrived to establish san antonio. [16] the majority of the few hundred texan and new mexican colonizers in the spanish colonial period were spaniards and criollos. [17] california  new mexico  and arizona all had spanish settlements. in 1781 spanish settlers founded los angeles. at the time they joined the u. s.  californios in california numbered about 10 000 and tejanos in texas about 4 000. new mexico had 47 000 spanish settlers in 1842. arizona was only thinly settled. however  not all these settlers were of european descent. as in the rest of the american colonies  new settlements were based on the casta system  and although all could speak spanish  it was really a melting pot of whites  natives  and mestizos. french [ edit]in the late 17th century  french expeditions established a foothold on the saint lawrence river  mississippi river  and gulf coast. interior trading posts  forts  and cities were thinly spread throughout louisiana such as saint louis  baton rouge  sault sainte marie  prairie du rocher  and sainte-geneviève. the city of detroit was the third largest settlement in new france. new orleans expanded when several thousand french-speaking refugees from the region of acadia (now nova scotia  canada) made their way to louisiana following british expulsion  settling largely in the southwest louisiana region now called acadiana. their descendants are now called cajun and still dominate the coastal areas. [18] it is estimated that 7 000 european immigrants settled in louisiana during the 18th century. population in 1790 [ edit]the following were the countries of origin for new arrivals to the united states before 1790. [19] the regions marked with an asterisk were part of great britain. the ancestry of the 3.9 million population in 1790 has been estimated by various sources by sampling last names from the 1790 census and assigning them a country of origin. the irish in the 1790 census were mostly scotch-irish. the french were primarily huguenots. the total u. s. catholic population in 1790 was probably less than 5%. the native american population inside territorial u. s. boundaries was less than 100 000.

[ citation needed]1790 to 1849 [ edit]there was relatively little immigration from 1770 to 1830; while there was significant emigration from the u. s. to canada  including about 75 000 loyalists as well as germans and others looking for better farmland in what is now ontario. large scale immigration resumed in the 1830s from britain  ireland  germany  and other parts of central europe as well as scandinavia. most were attracted by the cheap farmland. some were artisans and skilled factory workers attracted by the first stage of industrialization. the irish catholics were primarily unskilled workers who built a majority of the canals and railroads  settling in urban areas. many irish went to the emerging textile mill towns of the northeast  while others became longshoremen in the growing atlantic and gulf port cities. half the germans headed to farms  especially in the midwest (with some to texas)  while the other half became craftsmen in urban areas. nativism took the form of political anti-catholicism directed mostly at the irish (as well as germans). it became important briefly in the mid-1850s in the guise of the know nothing party. most of the catholics and german lutherans became democrats  and most of the other protestants joined the new republican party. during the civil war  ethnic communities supported the war and produced large numbers of soldiers on both sides. riots broke out in new york city and other irish and german strongholds in 1863 when a draft was instituted  particularly in light of the provision exempting those who could afford payment. based on available records  immigration totaled 8 385 in 1820  with immigration totals gradually increasing to 23 322 by the year 1830; for the 1820s decade immigration more than doubled to 143 000. between 1831 and 1840  immigration more than quadrupled to a total of 599 000. these included about 207 000 irish  starting to emigrate in large numbers following britains easing of travel restrictions  and about 152 000 germans  76 000 british  and 46 000 french  constituting the next largest immigrant groups of the decade. between 1841 and 1850  immigration nearly tripled again  totaling 1 713 000 immigrants  including at least 781 000 irish  435 000 germans  267 000 british  and 77 000 french. the irish  driven by the potato famine (1845–1849)  emigrated directly from their homeland to escape poverty and death. the failed revolutions of 1848 brought many intellectuals and activists to exile in the u. s. bad times and poor conditions in europe drove people out  while land  relatives  freedom  opportunity  and jobs in the us lured them in. population and foreign born 1790 to 1849 census population  immigrants per decade census population immigrants 1 foreign born %1790 3 918 000 60 0001800 5 236 000 60 0001810 7 036 000 60 0001820 10 086 000 60 0001830 12 785 000 143 000 200 000 2 1.6%1840 17 018 000 599 000 800 000 2 4.7%1850 23 054 000 1 713 000 2 244 000 9.7%1. the total number immigrating in each decade from 1790 to 1820 are estimates.2. the number of foreign born in 1830 and 1840 decades are extrapolations. starting in 1820  some federal records  including ship passenger lists  were kept for immigration purposes  and a gradual increase in immigration was recorded; more complete immigration records provide data on immigration after 1830. though conducted since 1790  the census of 1850 was the first in which place of birth was asked specifically. the foreign-born population in the u. s. likely reached its minimum around 1815  at approximately 100 000 or 1% of the population. by 1815  most of the immigrants who arrived before the american revolution had died  and there had been almost no new immigration thereafter. nearly all population growth up to 1830 was by internal increase; around 98% of the population was native-born. by 1850  this shifted to about 90% native-born. the first significant catholic immigration started in the mid-1840s  shifting the population from about 95% protestant down to about 90% by 1850. in 1848  the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo  concluding the mexican war  extended u. s. citizenship to approximately 60 000 mexican residents of the new mexico territory and 10 000 living in california. an additional approximate 2 500 foreign born california residents also become u. s. citizens. in 1849  the california gold rush attracted 100 000 would-be miners from the eastern u. s.  latin america  china  australia  and europe. california became a state in 1850 with a population of about 90 000.1850 to 1930 [ edit]from the old to the new world shows german emigrants boarding a steamer in hamburg and arriving in new york. harpers weekly  (new york) november 7  1874demography [ edit]between 1850 and 1930  about 5 million germans migrated to the united states  peaking between 1881 and 1885 when a million germans settled primarily in the midwest. between 1820 and 1930  3.5 million british and 4.5 million irish entered america. before 1845 most irish immigrants were protestants. after 1845  irish catholics began arriving in large numbers  largely driven by the great famine. [26]after 1880 larger steam-powered oceangoing ships replaced sailing ships  which resulted in lower fares and greater immigrant mobility. meanwhile  farming improvements in southern europe and the russian empire created surplus labor. young people between the ages of 15 to 30 were predominant among newcomers. this wave of migration  constituting the third episode in the history of u. s. immigration  may be better referred to as a flood of immigrants  as nearly 25 million europeans made the long trip. italians  greeks  hungarians  poles  and others speaking slavic languages made up the bulk of this migration. 2.5 to 4 million jews were among them. destinations [ edit]each group evinced a distinctive migration pattern in terms of the gender balance within the migratory pool  the permanence of their migration  their literacy rates  the balance between adults and children  and the like. but they shared one overarching characteristic they flocked to urban destinations and made up the bulk of the u. s. industrial labor pool  making possible the emergence of such industries as steel  coal  automotive  textile  and garment production  enabling the united states to leap into the front ranks of the worlds economic giants. their urban destinations  numbers  and perhaps an antipathy towards foreigners  led to the emergence of a second wave of organized xenophobia. by the 1890s  many americans  particularly from the ranks of the well-off  white  and native-born  considered immigration to pose a serious danger to the nations health and security. in 1893 a group formed the immigration restriction league  and it  along with other similarly inclined organizations  began to press congress for severe curtailment of foreign immigration. irish and german catholic immigration was opposed in the 1850s by the nativist / know nothing movement  originating in new york in 1843 as the american republican party (not to be confused with the modern republican party ). it was empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by catholic immigrants  who were often regarded as hostile to american values and controlled by the pope in rome. active mainly from 1854–56  it strove to curb immigration and naturalization  though its efforts met with little success. there were few prominent leaders  and the largely middle-class and protestant membership fragmented over the issue of slavery  most often joining the republican party by the time of the 1860 presidential election. [27] [28]european immigrants joined the union army in large numbers  including 177 000 born in germany and 144 000 born in ireland. [29] many germans could see the parallels between slavery and serfdom in the old fatherland. [30]between 1840 and 1930  about 900 000 french canadians left quebec in order to immigrate to the united states and settle  mainly in new england. considering the fact that the population of quebec was only 892 061 in 1851  this was a massive exodus. 13.6 million americans claimed to have french ancestry in the 1980 census. a large portion of them have ancestors who emigrated from french canada  since immigration from france was low throughout the history of the united states. during the same period almost 4 million other canadians immigrated to the u. s. in the new england states 12% of the population can trace its ancestry back to quebec and 10% can trace its ancestry back to the maritime provinces. shortly after the u. s. civil war  some states started to pass their own immigration laws  which prompted the u. s. supreme court to rule in 1875 that immigration was a federal responsibility. [31] in 1875  the nation passed its first immigration law  the page act of 1875  also known as the asian exclusion act  outlawing the importation of asian contract laborers  any asian woman who would engage in prostitution  and all people considered to be convicts in their own countries. [32]in 1882 congress passed the chinese exclusion act. by excluding all chinese laborers from entering the country  the chinese exclusion act severely curtailed the number of immigrants of chinese descent allowed into the united states for 10 years. [33] the law was renewed in 1892 and 1902. during this period  chinese migrants illegally entered the united states through the loosely guarded u. s.-canadian border. [34]illustration from walter crane s columbias courtship a picture history of the united states in twelve emblematic designs in color with accompanying verses (1893)prior to 1890  the individual states  rather than the federal government  regulated immigration into the united states. [35] the immigration act of 1891 established a commissioner of immigration in the treasury department. [36] the canadian agreement of 1894 extended u. s. immigration restrictions to canadian ports. late 19th century broadside advertisement offering cheap farm land to immigrants; few went to texas after 1860. the dillingham commission was set up by congress in 1907 to investigate the effects of immigration on the country. the commissions 40-volume analysis of immigration during the previous three decades led it to conclude that the major source of immigration had shifted from central  northern  and western europeans to southern europeans and russians. it was  however  apt to make generalizations about regional groups that were subjective and failed to differentiate between distinct cultural attributes. [37] [38]the 1910s marked the high point of italian immigration to the united states. over two million italians immigrated in those years  with a total of 5.3 million between 1880 and 1920. [39] [40] about half returned to italy  after working an average of five years in the u. s. [41]about 1.5 million swedes and norwegians immigrated to the united states within this period  due to opportunity in america and poverty and religious oppression in united sweden-norway. this accounted for around 20% of the total population of the kingdom at that time. they settled mainly in the midwest  especially minnesota and the dakotas. danes had comparably low immigration rates due to a better economy; after 1900 many danish immigrants were mormon converts who moved to utah. in this rosh hashana greeting card from the early 1900s  russian jews  packs in hand  gaze at the american relatives beckoning them to the united states. over two million jews fled the pogroms of the russian empire to the safety of the u. s. from 1881–1924. mulberry street  along which manhattans little italy is centered. lower east side  circa 1900. over two million central europeans  mainly catholics and jews  immigrated between 1880 and 1924. people of polish ancestry are the largest central european ancestry group in the united states after germans. immigration of eastern orthodox ethnic groups was much lower. lebanese and syrian immigrants started to settle in large numbers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. the vast majority of the immigrants from lebanon and syria were christians  but smaller numbers of jews  muslims  and druze also settled. many lived in new york citys little syria and in boston. in the 1920s and 1930s  a large number of these immigrants set out west  with detroit getting a large number of middle eastern immigrants  as well as many midwestern areas where the arabs worked as farmers. from 1880 to 1924  around two million jews moved to the united states  mostly seeking better opportunity in america and fleeing the pogroms of the russian empire. after 1934 jews  along with any other above-quota immigration  were usually denied access to the united states. congress passed a literacy requirement in 1917 to curb the influx of low-skilled immigrants from entering the country. congress passed the emergency quota act in 1921  followed by the immigration act of 1924  which was aimed at further restricting the southern europeans and russians who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s. this ultimately resulted in precluding all extra immigration to the united states  including jews fleeing nazi german persecution. the immigration act of 1924 set quotas for european immigrants so that no more than 2% of the 1890 immigrant stocks were allowed into america. new immigration [ edit]the sunday magazine of the new york world appealed to immigrants with this 1906 cover page celebrating their arrival at ellis island. new immigration was a term from the late 1880s that came from the influx of catholic and jewish immigrants from italy and russia (areas that previously sent few immigrants). [42] though the majority of immigrants came through new york  thus making the northeast a major target of settlement  there were various efforts  such as the galveston movement  to redirect immigrants to other ports and disperse some of the settlement to other areas of the country. nativists feared the new arrivals lacked the political  social  and occupational skills needed to successfully assimilate into american culture. this raised the issue of whether the u. s. was still a  melting pot   or if it had just become a dumping ground  and many old-stock americans worried about negative effects on the economy  politics  and culture. [43] a major proposal was to impose a literacy test  whereby applicants had to be able to read and write in their own language before they were admitted. [44]catholicism became a leading denomination 1860–1910. st. john cantius  one of chicago s  polish cathedrals  was one of the churches these new immigrants founded.1930 to 2000 [ edit]restriction proceeded piecemeal over the course of the late 19th and early 20th centuries  but immediately after the end of world war i (1914–18) and into the early 1920s  congress changed the nations basic policy about immigration. the national origins formula of 1921 (and its final form in 1924) not only restricted the number of immigrants who might enter the united states  but also assigned slots according to quotas based on national origins. a complicated piece of legislation  it essentially gave preference to immigrants from central  northern and western europe  severely limiting the numbers from russia and southern europe  and declared all potential immigrants from asia unworthy of entry into the united states. the legislation excluded the western hemisphere from the quota system  and the 1920s ushered in the penultimate era of u. s. immigration history. immigrants could and did move quite freely from mexico  the caribbean (including jamaica  barbados  and haiti)  and other parts of central and south america. this era  which reflected the application of the 1924 legislation  lasted until 1965. during those 40 years  the united states began to admit  case by case  limited numbers of refugees. jewish refugees from nazi germany before world war ii  jewish holocaust survivors after the war  non-jewish displaced persons fleeing communist rule in central europe and russia  hungarians seeking refuge after their failed uprising in 1956  and cubans after the 1960 revolution managed to find haven in the united states when their plight moved the collective conscience of america  but the basic immigration law remained in place. equal nationality act of 1934 [ edit]this law allowed foreign-born children of american mothers and alien fathers who had entered america before the age of 18 and had lived in america for five years to apply for american citizenship for the first time. [45] it also made the naturalization process quicker for the alien husbands of american wives. [45] this law equalized expatriation  immigration  naturalization  and repatriation between women and men. [45] [46] however  it was not applied retroactively  and was modified by later laws  such as the nationality act of 1940. [45] [47]tydings–mc duffie act [ edit]in 1934  the tydings–mc duffie act provided independence of the philippines on july 4  1946. until 1965  national origin quotas strictly limited immigration from the philippines. in 1965  after revision of the immigration law  significant filipino immigration began  totaling 1 728 000 by 2004. [48]postwar immigration [ edit]in 1945  the war brides act allowed foreign-born wives of u. s. citizens who had served in the u. s. armed forces to immigrate to the united states. in 1946  the war brides act was extended to include the fiancés of american soldiers. in 1946  the luce-celler act extended the right to become naturalized citizens to those from the newly independent nation of the philippines and to asian indians  the immigration quota being set at 100 people per year per country. [49]at the end of world war ii  regular immigration almost immediately increased under the official national origins quota system as refugees from war torn europe began immigrating to the u. s. after the war  there were jobs for nearly everyone who wanted one  when most women employed during the war went back into the home. from 1941 to 1950  1 035 000 people immigrated to the u. s.  including 226 000 from germany  139 000 from the uk  171 000 from canada  60 000 from mexico and 57 000 from italy. [50]the displaced persons act of 1948 finally allowed the displaced people of world war ii to start immigrating. [51] some 200 000 europeans and 17 000 orphans displaced by world war ii were initially allowed to immigrate to the united states outside of immigration quotas. president harry s. truman signed the first displaced persons (dp) act on june 25  1948  allowing entry for 200 000 dps  then followed with the more accommodating second dp act on june 16  1950  allowing entry for another 200 000. this quota  including acceptance of 55 000 volksdeutschen  required sponsorship for all immigrants. the american program was the most notoriously bureaucratic of all the dp programs and much of the humanitarian effort was undertaken by charitable organizations  such as the lutheran world federation as well as other ethnic groups. along with an additional quota of 200 000 granted in 1953 and more in succeeding years  a total of nearly 600 000 refugees were allowed into the country outside the quota system  second only to israels 650 000.1950s [ edit]in 1950  after the start of the korean war  the internal security act barred admission of communists  who might engage in activities which would be prejudicial to the public interest  or would endanger the welfare or safety of the united states. in 1950  the invasion of south korea by north korea started the korean war and left a war-ravaged korea behind. there was little u. s. immigration due to the national origin quotas of the immigration law. significant korean immigration began in 1965 after revision of the law  totaling 848 000 by 2004. in 1952  the mc carran walter immigration act affirmed the national-origins quota system of 1924 and limited total annual immigration to one-sixth of one percent of the population of the continental united states in 1920  or 175 455. this exempted the spouses and children of u. s. citizens and people born in the western hemisphere from the quota. in 1953  the refugee relief act extended refugee status to non-europeans. in 1954  operation wetback forced the return of thousands of illegal immigrants to mexico. [52] between 1944 and 1954  the decade of the wetback  the number of illegal immigrants coming from mexico increased by 6 000 percent. it is estimated that before operation wetback got under way  more than a million workers had crossed the rio grande illegally. cheap labor displaced native agricultural workers  and increased violation of labor laws and discrimination encouraged criminality  disease  and illiteracy. according to a study conducted in 1950 by the presidents commission on migratory labor in texas  the rio grande valley cotton growers were paying approximately half of the wages paid elsewhere in texas. the united states border patrol aided by municipal  county  state  federal authorities  and the military  began a quasi-military operation of the search and seizure of all illegal immigrants. fanning out from the lower rio grande valley  operation wetback moved northward. initially  illegal immigrants were repatriated through presidio because the mexican city across the border  ojinaga  had rail connections to the interior of mexico by which workers could be quickly moved on to durango. the forces used by the government were relatively small  perhaps no more than 700 men  but were augmented by border patrol officials who hoped to scare illegal workers into fleeing back to mexico. ships became a preferred mode of transport because they carried illegal workers farther from the border than buses  trucks  or trains. it is difficult to estimate the number of illegal immigrants that left due to the operation—most voluntarily. the ins claimed as many as 1 300 000  though the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total. the program was ultimately abandoned due to questions surrounding the ethics of its implementation. citizens of mexican descent complained of police stopping all mexican looking people and utilizing extreme police-state methods including deportation of american-born children who were citizens by law. [53]the failed 1956 hungarian revolution  before being crushed by the soviets  forged a temporary hole in the iron curtain that allowed a burst of refugees to escape  bringing in 245 000 new hungarian families by 1960. from 1950 to 1960  the u. s. had 2 515 000 new immigrants with 477 000 arriving from germany  185 000 from italy  52 000 new arrivals from the netherlands  203 000 from the uk  46 000 from japan  300 000 from mexico  and 377 000 from canada. the 1959 cuban revolution led by fidel castro drove the upper and middle classes to exile  and 409 000 families immigrated to the u. s. by 1970. [54] this was facilitated by the 1966 cuban adjustment act  which gave permanent resident status to cubans physically present in the united states for one year if they entered after january 1  1959. hart-celler act [ edit]this all changed with passage of the hart-celler act in 1965  a by-product of the civil rights revolution and a jewel in the crown of president lyndon johnsons great society programs. the measure had not been intended to stimulate immigration from asia  the middle east  africa  and elsewhere in the developing world. rather  by doing away with the racially based quota system  its authors had expected that immigrants would come from traditional societies such as italy  greece  and portugal  places that labored under very small quotas in the 1924 law. the law replaced the quotas with preferential categories based on family relationships and job skills  giving particular preference to potential immigrants with relatives in the united states and with occupations deemed critical by the u. s. department of labor. after 1970  however  following an initial influx from european countries  immigrants from places like korea  china  india  the philippines  and pakistan  as well as countries in africa became more common.1980s [ edit]in 1986  the immigration reform and control act (irca) was passed  creating  for the first time  penalties for employers who hired illegal immigrants. irca  as proposed in congress  was projected to give amnesty to about 1 000 000 workers in the country illegally. in practice  amnesty for about 3 000 000 immigrants already in the united states was granted. most were from mexico. legal mexican immigrant family numbers were 2 198 000 in 1980  4 289 000 in 1990 (includes irca)  and 7 841 000 in 2000. adding another 12 000 000 illegal immigrants of which about 80% are thought to be mexicans would bring the mexican family total to over 16 000 000—about 16% of the mexican population.

benefit a means-tested benefit is a public benefit where the agency granting the benefit considers your income and resources. means-tested benefits may be federally  state  or locally funded. in general  if you receive a benefit that was granted based on your income  we consider it a means-tested benefit. the table below lists some examples of what uscis considers a means-tested benefit for eligibility of fee waivers. identifying federal means-tested programs means-tested benefit programs not means-tested benefit programs examples include medicaid supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap  formerly called food stamps)temporary assistance to needy families (tanf)supplemental security income (ssi)examples include medicare unemployment benefits social security benefits social security disability insurance (ssdi)retirement  survivors and disability insurance (rsdi)student financial aid/loans/grants if you are receiving a means-tested benefit that is not well known outside of your area  please provide as much information as you can about the benefit. this may include a brochure  contact information  or the website address of the agency granting the benefit. you must provide evidence that you are currently receiving a means-tested benefit. computer printouts are acceptable as long as they include the required information. this evidence should be in the form of a letter  notice  or other official document that contains the required information  including your name the name of the agency granting you the public benefit the type of benefit  and an indication that you are currently receiving the benefit (for example  the date granted  expiration date  and/or date of renewal  if available). a benefit card by itself is not acceptable evidence of a means-tested benefit  unless it contains all four of the requirements above. if you are filing on behalf of a child  provide the information and documentation of the means-tested benefit that the child receives. who may use your means-tested benefits to qualify your spouse may use your means-tested benefit to qualify for a fee waiver as long as you are residing with your spouse and are not legally separated. if you have a child under 21 years of age  that child may use your means-tested benefit to qualify for a fee waiver. the person filing for the child must provide evidence of the parent-child relationship  such as a photocopy of a birth certificate. who may use your child's means-tested benefit to qualify uscis has never allowed a parent to use a child's means-tested benefit to qualify for a fee waiver. however  as with all fee waiver adjudications  uscis reviews all the information and documentation received to determine if an applicant qualifies under any basis of eligibility. therefore  while we will consider your child's means-tested benefit when determining your eligibility  we will not approve your application under option 1 of part 1. basis for request of form i-912 based only on your child's means-tested benefit. a child's means-tested benefit cannot be used by anyone else as the basis for eligibility under part 5. means-tested benefits of form i-912. however  if the child's means-tested benefit document or agency approval letter states the total household income in which the child is a member  other household members may use the document to qualify for a fee waiver under ""part 5. income at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines"" or ""part 6. financial hardship.""if you have children (under the age of 21) who receive means-tested benefits and want to file together if multiple children (siblings) are filing at the same time  each child must be receiving an individual means-tested benefit or be in the household of the parent or guardian who is receiving a means-tested benefit. if you have an adult disabled child (21 years of age or older)although uscis does not accept a parent's means-tested benefit for adult children  an adult child or legal ward who is physically or developmentally disabled or mentally impaired (and who is unmarried and cannot adequately care for themselves  or establish  maintain  or re-establish their own household) may qualify based on his or her own means-tested benefit. the adult child may have an assigned representative for the means-tested benefit. in addition  the parent or legal guardian may provide the information about the custody and the disability in the financial hardship section. if you have a child (21 years of age or older) who is going to college and is dependent on your household a college student (21 years of age or older) may not use a parent's means-tested benefit. however  a college student can independently qualify for a fee waiver based on either financial hardship or income below 150% of the federal poverty guidelines. any information about the parent's means-tested benefit can be included under the financial hardship or income below 150% of the federal poverty guidelines parts of form i-912. how to show you are currently receiving a means-tested benefit you must provide evidence that you are currently receiving a means-tested benefit. computer printouts are acceptable as long as they include the required information. this evidence should be in the form of a letter  notice  or other official document that contains the required information including your name (or the name of the person receiving the benefit) the name of the agency granting the public benefit the type of benefit  and an indication that you are currently receiving the benefit (for example  the date granted  expiration date  and/or date of renewal  if available. )if your document does not show an expiration date for the means-tested benefit you currently receive if the document does not have an expiration date  uscis will review the date on the letter or issuance date to confirm it is within 12 months of the date you filed your form i-912. the documentation provided should not be dated more than 12 months from the date you file form i-912. if the documentation is more than 12 months old and you are still receiving the benefit  provide additional evidence that shows you are currently receiving the benefit. benefit cards are not accepted as evidence benefit cards by themselves are not acceptable evidence of a means-tested benefit  unless they contain your name  the name of the agency granting you the public benefit  the type of benefit  and an indication that you currently receive the benefit (for example  the date you were granted the benefit and the date it expires or was renewed). states usually do not require applicants to return cards  without any value  after the expiration of benefits. top how to show that your household income is at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines you may qualify for a fee waiver if your household income is at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines at the time you file. check the current poverty levels for this year at form i-912p  hhs poverty guidelines for fee waiver requests. you must list the head of household's income on your fee

the majority of the income for your household. you can find more information about head of household when filing the irs form 1040 at http//www.irs.gov/publications/p501. if you are requesting a fee waiver based on household income that is at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines and your spouse lives overseas and provides support to your household  include your spouse's contributions to your household in the total additional income or financial support section. if your spouse living overseas is unemployed and is supported by you  state that on the form. if your spouse lives overseas and provides no support to your household  please include a statement explaining the situation. we will consider homelessness when reviewing a fee waiver request. if you receive services from a homeless shelter  please include a currently dated letter from the shelter. the letter should be on the shelter's letterhead  include a statement that you receive services from the shelter  and be signed by a shelter employee attesting to your situation. if you are homeless but do not reside in a shelter  please include an affidavit from a member of good standing in your community who knows you and can support your claim that you are homeless and unable to pay the fee (s). top how to show that you have a financial hardship include a detailed description of why you have financial hardship on the form and provide evidence. if you cannot provide evidence of financial hardship  include in your description an explanation of why you cannot provide evidence. it is always advisable to include an affidavit from a member of good standing in your community who knows you and can provide more insight into your situation. if you lost all forms of evidence in a natural disaster  fire  robbery  or through other means  include an explanation in your description. please provide a copy of a police report  insurance claim or other report  if available  to support your claim. top determining who counts toward your household size and income you count someone as part of your household size if that person is you;the head of your household (if not you). if the child (under 21 years of age) is applying individually  provide the information of the primary custodial parent;your spouse living with you (if you are separated or your spouse is not living with you  do not include your spouse); or any of the following family members who live with you your children or legal wards  who are unmarried and under 21 years of age;your children or legal wards  who are unmarried and are at least 21 years of age but under 24 years of age  are full-time students  and who live with you when not at school;your children or legal wards  who are unmarried and for whom you are the legal guardian because they are physically or developmentally disabled or mentally impaired to the extent that they cannot adequately care for themselves and cannot establish  maintain  or re-establish their own household;your parents; and any other dependents listed on your federal tax return  or on your spouse's or head of household's federal tax returns. you must include the annual income of your household members as part of your household income. my relative or roommate lives with me  does their income count toward my household income? if someone lives with you but does not meet the definition of a household member as described above  do not count that person's income as part of your household income. you should count the specific amount of any financial contribution that you receive from them only if that money was used to support your household. you would list that amount under the additional income or financial support section. example 1 if your uncle lives in your house (which you own) and paid $1 000 towards your mortgage  that $1 000 would be included under additional income or financial support because it was financial support provided to your household. example 2 you share an apartment with a roommate who is not a household member. you pay your own expenses  and your roommate pays his expenses. your roommate's income is not part of your household income because the roommate is not financially supporting you. therefore  you do not include the roommate's income as part of your household income. i receive child support  but not the full amount as listed in the court order. do i include the full amount of the child support as additional income or financial support or only what i actually receive? annotate the actual amount of child support received. if there is a difference between what is stated in a court order or documentation  provide an explanation. examples of documents may include bank statements  copies of checks  court documents  or other documentation indicating the actual income or financial assistance you are receiving. top how marital separation affects eligibility if you are requesting a fee waiver based on income at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines and are not including your spouse's income because of a marital separation  please provide a signed statement or documentation to establish that your spouse does not live with you and provides no income assistance. acceptable documents may include a copy of the court order that formalized your legal separation  a formal notarized property settlement agreement  financial support agreement  or separate mortgage  lease  or utility bills that show you and your spouse live apart. even if you are separated from your spouse  your household income includes any monthly support payments that you receive from your spouse. top how an affidavit of support affects eligibility if someone filed a form i-134  affidavit of support  or form i-864  affidavit of support under section 213a of the act  for you  that person may still be responsible for supporting you. however  we will consider that person's income or assets in deciding whether you are eligible for a fee waiver only if that person is currently a member of your household. top how requesting a fee waiver affects your current immigration status relying primarily on public cash assistance for income maintenance can affect your eligibility for some immigration benefits  depending on the totality of the circumstances. you may be inadmissible to the united states (and therefore ineligible for certain immigration benefits like a green card) because you are more likely than not to become a public charge. you may also be deportable for already having become a public charge within 5 years of entering the united states for reasons that arose before you entered the country. you can find detailed guidance on these issues published in the may 26  1999  edition of the federal register (64 fed. reg. 28689) and by searching for ""public charge"" at www.uscis.gov. when deciding your fee waiver request  we will not consider the possibility that you might be inadmissible or deportable as a public charge. we decide your fee waiver request separately from making a decision about your eligibility for the immigration benefit. however  being inadmissible as a public charge may make you ineligible for the benefit you seek. we will deny your application or petition if we determine that it involves false documentation  misrepresentation of facts  or other fraud  including fraud on this fee waiver request. top common reasons why we deny fee waiver requests the form for which you are making the request is not eligible for a fee waiver. you did not sign your form i-912 or the written request. all applicants (those 14 years of age or older) filing the request did not sign form i-912 or the written request (or  if under 14 years of age  did not have a parent or legal guardian sign for them). you did not provide evidence that you are currently receiving a means-tested benefit;your household income is at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines; or you are currently experiencing a financial hardship. you submitted evidence in support of your fee waiver request that is not in english  and you did not provide a certified english translation. if uscis denied your fee waiver and you are not sure why  please read the denial notice (form i-797  notice of action). if  after checking the denial notice  you still do not understand why we denied your fee waiver request  you may email us at lockboxsupport@uscis.dhs.gov. top last reviewed/updated 06/02/2016 https//www.uscis.gov/i-485 i-485  application to

sponsor family for a green card the permanent resident card (green card) is a document that is proof of an immigrants right to live in the u. s. as a permanent resident. relatives of u. s. citizens receive green cards quickest compared to relatives of permanent residents. certain members of a green card holders family can also apply for their own green cards. for most immigrants  the journey to permanent residence in the u. s. begins when a u. s. citizen or green card holder relative files form i-130  sponsor family for a green card  with the uscis. who can i help immigrate to the u. s. as a citizen? u. s. citizens can file for the following relatives immigration using form i-130 natural parents  step-parents and adoptive parents unmarried sons and daughters under the age of 21husbands and wives brothers and sisters  adopted siblings  step-siblings and half siblings married children or children over the age of 21what is the next step after filing form i-130?family members already living in the united states legally can file their application to register permanent residence as soon as you file form i-130 for them. this is called concurrent filing. parents  children and spouses of u. s. citizens can concurrently file because they do not have to wait for a visa number to become available. if the family member lives outside the u. s. when the national visa center (nvc) assigns their visa number  then the nvc will send the family members immigration petition and visa number to their local u. s. consulate or embassy. the local agency will advise your family member to visit the agency to complete consular processing. who can i petition for immigration as a u. s. permanent resident (green card holder)? the following relatives may apply to immigrate after the uscis approves the green card holders form i-130 petition spouses children there may be a wait for a visa number because the u. s. limits the number of visas given to children in these categories each year. what is the next step after the petition is filed? the nvc assigns your uscis-approved petition a priority date  which is the date of receipt for the application. once no more visa numbers are available for a given year  a wait list develops. at the top of the list is the priority date of the first person who otherwise qualifies for a visa number but cant get one (the cut-off date). as long as there is a cut-off date  the uscis only gives visa numbers to people who have priority dates earlier than the current cut-off date. once the annual limit of visa numbers is reached  the cut-off date changes  so the u. s. department of state announces the current cut-off date in a monthly visa bulletin. if your family member is inside the u. s. with temporary permission from the uscis at the time that they receive a visa number  they will then file the form i-485 green card application. if your family member is outside of the u. s. at the time that they receive a visa number  the nvc will send your petition and their visa number to the family members local u. s. consulate or embassy  which will advise the family member to come in to complete visa processing. how long does it take for the uscis to process form i-130? it may take six months or more for the uscis to process and approve form i-130 from the time that you send it in. however  this is often only the first step for helping your relatives immigrate to the united states. their wait for a visa number may take additional time on top of the i-130 wait time. how much does it cost to sponsor a family member for a green
